    \title OpenGL Examples from the Qt OpenGL module
    \brief Accessing OpenGL from Qt.
    \group examples-widgets-opengl

    \image opengl-examples.png

    These examples describe how to use the \l {Qt OpenGL} module. For new code,
    please use the OpenGL classes in the \l {Qt GUI} module.

    Qt provides support for integration with OpenGL implementations on all
    platforms, giving developers the opportunity to display hardware accelerated
    3D graphics alongside a more conventional user interface.

    These examples demonstrate the basic techniques used to take advantage of
    OpenGL in Qt applications.
