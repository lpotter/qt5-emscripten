    \class QGLBuffer
    \inmodule QtOpenGL
    \brief The QGLBuffer class provides functions for creating and managing GL buffer objects.
    \since 4.7
    \obsolete
    \ingroup painting-3D

    Buffer objects are created in the GL server so that the
    client application can avoid uploading vertices, indices,
    texture image data, etc every time they are needed.

    QGLBuffer objects can be copied around as a reference to the
    underlying GL buffer object:

    \code
    QGLBuffer buffer1(QGLBuffer::IndexBuffer);
    buffer1.create();

    QGLBuffer buffer2 = buffer1;
    \endcode

    QGLBuffer performs a shallow copy when objects are copied in this
    manner, but does not implement copy-on-write semantics.  The original
    object will be affected whenever the copy is modified.

    \note This class has been deprecated in favor of QOpenGLBuffer.
*/

/*!
    \enum QGLBuffer::Type
    This enum defines the type of GL buffer object to create with QGLBuffer.

    \value VertexBuffer Vertex buffer object for use when specifying
           vertex arrays.
    \value IndexBuffer Index buffer object for use with \c{glDrawElements()}.
    \value PixelPackBuffer Pixel pack buffer object for reading pixel
           data from the GL server (for example, with \c{glReadPixels()}).
           Not supported under OpenGL/ES.
    \value PixelUnpackBuffer Pixel unpack buffer object for writing pixel
           data to the GL server (for example, with \c{glTexImage2D()}).
           Not supported under OpenGL/ES.
*/

/*!
    \enum QGLBuffer::UsagePattern
    This enum defines the usage pattern of a QGLBuffer object.

    \value StreamDraw The data will be set once and used a few times
           for drawing operations.  Under OpenGL/ES 1.1 this is identical
           to StaticDraw.
    \value StreamRead The data will be set once and used a few times
           for reading data back from the GL server.  Not supported
           under OpenGL/ES.
    \value StreamCopy The data will be set once and used a few times
           for reading data back from the GL server for use in further
           drawing operations.  Not supported under OpenGL/ES.
    \value StaticDraw The data will be set once and used many times
           for drawing operations.
    \value StaticRead The data will be set once and used many times
           for reading data back from the GL server.  Not supported
           under OpenGL/ES.
    \value StaticCopy The data will be set once and used many times
           for reading data back from the GL server for use in further
           drawing operations.  Not supported under OpenGL/ES.
    \value DynamicDraw The data will be modified repeatedly and used
           many times for drawing operations.
    \value DynamicRead The data will be modified repeatedly and used
           many times for reading data back from the GL server.
           Not supported under OpenGL/ES.
    \value DynamicCopy The data will be modified repeatedly and used
           many times for reading data back from the GL server for
           use in further drawing operations.  Not supported under OpenGL/ES.

    \enum QGLBuffer::Access
    This enum defines the access mode for QGLBuffer::map().

    \value ReadOnly The buffer will be mapped for reading only.
    \value WriteOnly The buffer will be mapped for writing only.
    \value ReadWrite The buffer will be mapped for reading and writing.
