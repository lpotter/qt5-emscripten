    \class QActionGroup
    \brief The QActionGroup class groups actions together.

    \ingroup mainwindow-classes
    \inmodule QtWidgets

    In some situations it is useful to group QAction objects together.
    For example, if you have a \uicontrol{Left Align} action, a \uicontrol{Right
    Align} action, a \uicontrol{Justify} action, and a \uicontrol{Center} action,
    only one of these actions should be active at any one time. One
    simple way of achieving this is to group the actions together in
    an action group.

    Here's a example (from the \l{mainwindows/menus}{Menus} example):

    \snippet mainwindows/menus/mainwindow.cpp 6

    Here we create a new action group. Since the action group is
    exclusive by default, only one of the actions in the group is
    checked at any one time.

    \image qactiongroup-align.png Alignment options in a QMenu

    A QActionGroup emits an triggered() signal when one of its
    actions is chosen. Each action in an action group emits its
    triggered() signal as usual.

    As stated above, an action group is \l exclusive by default; it
    ensures that only one checkable action is active at any one time.
    If you want to group checkable actions without making them
    exclusive, you can turn of exclusiveness by calling
    setExclusive(false).

    Actions can be added to an action group using addAction(), but it
    is usually more convenient to specify a group when creating
    actions; this ensures that actions are automatically created with
    a parent. Actions can be visually separated from each other by
    adding a separator action to the group; create an action and use
    QAction's \l {QAction::}{setSeparator()} function to make it
    considered a separator. Action groups are added to widgets with
    the QWidget::addActions() function.
