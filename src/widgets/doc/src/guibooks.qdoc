    \title Books about GUI Design
    \ingroup best-practices
    \brief Some recommended books about GUI design.

    This is not a comprehensive list -- there are many other books worth
    buying. Here we mention just a few user interface books that don't
    gather dust on our shelves.

    \b{\l{http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132354160/ref=ase_trolltech/}{C++
    GUI Programming with Qt 4, Second Edition}}
    by Jasmin Blanchette and Mark
    Summerfield, ISBN 0-13-235416-0. This is the official Qt book written
    by two veteran Qt Developers. The first edition, which is based on Qt 4.1, is
    \l{http://www.qtrac.eu/C++-GUI-Programming-with-Qt-4-1st-ed.zip}{available for free online}.
    The second edition, based on Qt 4.3, is
    \l{http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0132354160}{available for purchase as an eBook}.
    The book predates QML and only covers widget based user interfaces.

    \b{\l{http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385267746/trolltech/t}{The Design of Everyday Things}}
    by Donald Norman, ISBN 0-38526774-6, is one of the classics of human
    interface design. Norman shows how badly something as simple as a
    kitchen stove can be designed, and everyone should read it who will
    design a dialog box, write an error message, or design just about
    anything else humans are supposed to use.

    \target fowler
    \b{\l{http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070592748/trolltech/t}{GUI Design Handbook}}
    by Susan Fowler, ISBN 0-07-059274-8, is an
    alphabetical dictionary of widgets and other user interface elements,
    with comprehensive coverage of each. Each chapter covers one widget
    or other element, contains the most important recommendation from the
    \macos, Windows and Motif style guides, notes about common
    problems, comparison with other widgets that can serve some of the
    same roles as this one, etc.

    \target Design Patterns
    \b{\l{http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612/103-8144203-3273444}
    {Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software}}
    by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides, ISBN 0-201-63361-2, provides
    more information on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, explaining
    MVC and its sub-patterns in detail.

    \b{\l{http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201622165/trolltech/t}{Macintosh
    Human Interface Guidelines}}, Second Edition, ISBN
    0-201-62216-5, is worth buying for the \e {don't}s alone. Even
    if you are not writing software for \macos, avoiding most of what it
    advises against will produce more easily comprehensible software.
    Doing what it tells you to do may also help.

    \b{\l{http://www.amazon.com/New-Windows-Interface-Microsoft-Press/dp/1556156790/}{The
    Microsoft Windows User Experience}}, ISBN 1-55615-679-0,
    is Microsoft's look and feel bible. Indispensable for everyone who
    has customers that worship Microsoft, and it's quite good, too.

    \b{\l{http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047159900X/trolltech/t}{The Icon Book}}
    by William Horton, ISBN 0-471-59900-X, is perhaps the only thorough
    coverage of icons and icon use in software. In order for icons to be
    successful, people must be able to do four things with them: decode,
    recognize, find and activate them. This book explains these goals
    from scratch and how to reach them, both with single icons and icon
    families. Some 500 examples are scattered throughout the text.
