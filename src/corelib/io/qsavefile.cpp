    \class QSaveFile
    \inmodule QtCore
    \brief The QSaveFile class provides an interface for safely writing to files.

    \ingroup io

    \reentrant

    \since 5.1

    QSaveFile is an I/O device for writing text and binary files, without losing
    existing data if the writing operation fails.

    While writing, the contents will be written to a temporary file, and if
    no error happened, commit() will move it to the final file. This ensures that
    no data at the final file is lost in case an error happens while writing,
    and no partially-written file is ever present at the final location. Always
    use QSaveFile when saving entire documents to disk.

    QSaveFile automatically detects errors while writing, such as the full partition
    situation, where write() cannot write all the bytes. It will remember that
    an error happened, and will discard the temporary file in commit().

    Much like with QFile, the file is opened with open(). Data is usually read
    and written using QDataStream or QTextStream, but you can also call the
    QIODevice-inherited functions read(), readLine(), readAll(), write().

    Unlike QFile, calling close() is not allowed. commit() replaces it. If commit()
    was not called and the QSaveFile instance is destroyed, the temporary file is
    discarded.

    To abort saving due to an application error, call cancelWriting(), so that
    even a call to commit() later on will not save.

/*!
  Allows writing over the existing file if necessary.

  QSaveFile creates a temporary file in the same directory as the final
  file and atomically renames it. However this is not possible if the
  directory permissions do not allow creating new files.
  In order to preserve atomicity guarantees, open() fails when it
  cannot create the temporary file.

  In order to allow users to edit files with write permissions in a
  directory with restricted permissions, call setDirectWriteFallback() with
  \a enabled set to true, and the following calls to open() will fallback to
  opening the existing file directly and writing into it, without the use of
  a temporary file.
  This does not have atomicity guarantees, i.e. an application crash or
  for instance a power failure could lead to a partially-written file on disk.
  It also means cancelWriting() has no effect, in such a case.

  Typically, to save documents edited by the user, call setDirectWriteFallback(true),
  and to save application internal files (configuration files, data files, ...), keep
  the default setting which ensures atomicity.
