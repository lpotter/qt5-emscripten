The file qurltlds_p.h is generated from the Public Suffix
List (see [1] and [2]), by the program residing at
util/corelib/qurl-generateTLDs in the Qt source tree.

That program generates a character array and an index array from the
list to provide fast lookups of elements within C++.

Those arrays in qurltlds_p.h are derived from the Public
Suffix List ([2]), which was originally provided by
Jo Hermans <jo.hermans@gmail.com>.
