    \class QEvent
    \inmodule QtCore
    \brief The QEvent class is the base class of all
    event classes. Event objects contain event parameters.

    \ingroup events

    Qt's main event loop (QCoreApplication::exec()) fetches native
    window system events from the event queue, translates them into
    QEvents, and sends the translated events to \l{QObject}s.

    In general, events come from the underlying window system
    (spontaneous() returns \c true), but it is also possible to manually
    send events using QCoreApplication::sendEvent() and
    QCoreApplication::postEvent() (spontaneous() returns \c false).

    \l {QObject}{QObjects} receive events by having their QObject::event() function
    called. The function can be reimplemented in subclasses to
    customize event handling and add additional event types;
    QWidget::event() is a notable example. By default, events are
    dispatched to event handlers like QObject::timerEvent() and
    QWidget::mouseMoveEvent(). QObject::installEventFilter() allows an
    object to intercept events destined for another object.

    The basic QEvent contains only an event type parameter and an
    "accept" flag.  The accept flag set with accept(), and cleared
    with ignore(). It is set by default, but don't rely on this as
    subclasses may choose to clear it in their constructor.

    Subclasses of QEvent contain additional parameters that describe
    the particular event.

    \sa QObject::event(), QObject::installEventFilter(),
        QCoreApplication::sendEvent(),
        QCoreApplication::postEvent(), QCoreApplication::processEvents()

    \enum QEvent::Type

    This enum type defines the valid event types in Qt. The event
    types and the specialized classes for each type are as follows:

                                            is sent to the active window. This allows clients (e.g. widgets)
                                            to signal that they will handle the shortcut themselves, by

    \omitvalue ThemeChange
    \value ThreadChange                     The object is moved to another thread. This is the last event sent to this object in the previous thread. See QObject::moveToThread().
    \value Timer                            Regular timer events (QTimerEvent).
    \value ToolBarChange                    The toolbar button is toggled on \macos.
    \value ToolTip                          A tooltip was requested (QHelpEvent).
    \value ToolTipChange                    The widget's tooltip has changed.
    \value TouchBegin                       Beginning of a sequence of touch-screen or track-pad events (QTouchEvent).
    \value TouchCancel                      Cancellation of touch-event sequence (QTouchEvent).
    \value TouchEnd                         End of touch-event sequence (QTouchEvent).
    \value TouchUpdate                      Touch-screen event (QTouchEvent).
    \value UngrabKeyboard                   Item loses keyboard grab (QGraphicsItem only).

    \value UpdateLater                      The widget should be queued to be repainted at a later time.
    \value UpdateRequest                    The widget should be repainted.
    \value WhatsThis                        The widget should reveal "What's This?" help (QHelpEvent).
    \value WhatsThisClicked                 A link in a widget's "What's This?" help was clicked.
    \value Wheel                            Mouse wheel rolled (QWheelEvent).
    \value WinEventAct                      A Windows-specific activation event has occurred.
    \value WindowActivate                   Window was activated.
    \value WindowBlocked                    The window is blocked by a modal dialog.
    \value WindowDeactivate                 Window was deactivated.
    \value WindowIconChange                 The window's icon has changed.

    \value ZOrderChange                     The widget's z-order has changed. This event is never sent to top level windows.

    User events should have values between \c User and \c{MaxUser}:

    \value User                             User-defined event.
    \value MaxUser                          Last user event ID.

    For convenience, you can use the registerEventType() function to
    register and reserve a custom event type for your
    application. Doing so will allow you to avoid accidentally
    re-using a custom event type already in use elsewhere in your
    application.
