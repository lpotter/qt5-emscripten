/*! \fn template <typename Functor> bool qWaitFor(Functor predicate, int timeout)
    \relates QTest

    Waits for \a timeout milliseconds or until the \a predicate returns true.

    Returns \c true if the \a predicate returned true at any point, otherwise returns \c false.

    Example:

    \code
        MyObject obj;
        obj.startup();
        QTest::qWaitFor([&]() {
            return obj.isReady();
        }, 3000);
    \endcode

    The code above will wait for the object to become ready, for a
    maximum of three seconds.

    \since 5.10
*/


/*! \fn void qWait(int ms)
    \relates QTest

    Waits for \a ms milliseconds. While waiting, events will be processed and
    your test will stay responsive to user interface events or network communication.

    Example:

    \code
        int i = 0;
        while (myNetworkServerNotResponding() && i++ < 50)
            QTest::qWait(250);

    The code above will wait until the network server is responding for a
    maximum of about 12.5 seconds.
