    \class QDeadlineTimer
    \inmodule QtCore
    \brief The QDeadlineTimer class marks a deadline in the future.
    \since 5.8

    \reentrant
    \ingroup tools

    The QDeadlineTimer class is usually used to calculate future deadlines and
    verify whether the deadline has expired. QDeadlineTimer can also be used
    for deadlines without expiration ("forever"). It forms a counterpart to
    QElapsedTimer, which calculates how much time has elapsed since
    QElapsedTimer::start() was called.

    QDeadlineTimer provides a more convenient API compared to
    QElapsedTimer::hasExpired().

    The typical use-case for the class is to create a QDeadlineTimer before the
    operation in question is started, and then use remainingTime() or
    hasExpired() to determine whether to continue trying the operation.
    QDeadlineTimer objects can be passed to functions being called to execute
    this operation so they know how long to still operate.

    \code
    void executeOperation(int msecs)
    {
        QDeadlineTimer deadline(msecs);
        do {
            if (readFromDevice(deadline.remainingTime())
                break;
            waitForReadyRead(deadline);
        } while (!deadline.hasExpired());
    }
    \endcode

    Many QDeadlineTimer functions deal with time out values, which all are
    measured in milliseconds. There are two special values, the same as many
    other Qt functions named \c{waitFor} or similar:

    \list
      \li 0: no time left, expired
      \li -1: infinite time left, timer never expires
    \endlist

    \section1 Reference Clocks

    QDeadlineTimer will use the same clock as QElapsedTimer (see
    QElapsedTimer::clockType() and QElapsedTimer::isMonotonic()).

    \section1 Timer types

    Like QTimer, QDeadlineTimer can select among different levels of coarseness
    on the timers. You can select precise timing by passing Qt::PreciseTimer to
    the functions that set of change the timer, or you can select coarse timing
    by passing Qt::CoarseTimer. Qt::VeryCoarseTimer is currently interpreted
    the same way as Qt::CoarseTimer.

    This feature is dependent on support from the operating system: if the OS
    does not support a coarse timer functionality, then QDeadlineTimer will
    behave like Qt::PreciseTimer was passed.

    QDeadlineTimer defaults to Qt::CoarseTimer because on operating systems
    that do support coarse timing, making timing calls to that clock source is
    often much more efficient. The level of coarseness depends on the
    operating system, but should be in the order of a couple of milliseconds.

    \section1 \c{std::chrono} Compatibility

    QDeadlineTimer is compatible with the \c{std::chrono} API from C++11 and
    can be constructed from or compared to both \c{std::chrono::duration} and
    \c{std::chrono::time_point} objects. In addition, it is fully compatible
    with the time literals from C++14, which allow one to write code as:

    \code
        using namespace std::chrono;
        using namespace std::chrono_literals;

        QDeadlineTimer deadline(30s);
        device->waitForReadyRead(deadline);
        if (deadline.remainingTime<nanoseconds>() > 300ms)
            cleanup();
    \endcode

    As can be seen in the example above, QDeadlineTimer offers a templated
    version of remainingTime() and deadline() that can be used to return
    \c{std::chrono} objects.

    Note that comparing to \c{time_point} is not as efficient as comparing to
    \c{duration}, since QDeadlineTimer may need to convert from its own
    internal clock source to the clock source used by the \c{time_point} object.
    Also note that, due to this conversion, the deadlines will not be precise,
    so the following code is not expected to compare equally:

    \code
        using namespace std::chrono;
        using namespace std::chrono_literals;
        auto now = steady_clock::now();
        QDeadlineTimer deadline(now + 1s);
        Q_ASSERT(deadline == now + 1s);
    \endcode
