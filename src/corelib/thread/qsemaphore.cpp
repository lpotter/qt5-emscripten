    \class QSemaphore
    \inmodule QtCore
    \brief The QSemaphore class provides a general counting semaphore.

    \threadsafe

    \ingroup thread

    A semaphore is a generalization of a mutex. While a mutex can
    only be locked once, it's possible to acquire a semaphore
    multiple times. Semaphores are typically used to protect a
    certain number of identical resources.

    Semaphores support two fundamental operations, acquire() and
    release():

    \list
    \li acquire(\e{n}) tries to acquire \e n resources. If there aren't
       that many resources available, the call will block until this
       is the case.
    \li release(\e{n}) releases \e n resources.
    \endlist

    There's also a tryAcquire() function that returns immediately if
    it cannot acquire the resources, and an available() function that
    returns the number of available resources at any time.

    Example:

    \snippet code/src_corelib_thread_qsemaphore.cpp 0

    A typical application of semaphores is for controlling access to
    a circular buffer shared by a producer thread and a consumer
    thread. The \l{Semaphores Example} shows how
    to use QSemaphore to solve that problem.

    A non-computing example of a semaphore would be dining at a
    restaurant. A semaphore is initialized with the number of chairs
    in the restaurant. As people arrive, they want a seat. As seats
    are filled, available() is decremented. As people leave, the
    available() is incremented, allowing more people to enter. If a
    party of 10 people want to be seated, but there are only 9 seats,
    those 10 people will wait, but a party of 4 people would be
    seated (taking the available seats to 5, making the party of 10
    people wait longer).

/*
    QSemaphore futex operation

    QSemaphore stores a 32-bit integer with the counter of currently available
    tokens (value between 0 and INT_MAX). When a thread attempts to acquire n
    tokens and the counter is larger than that, we perform a compare-and-swap
    with the new count. If that succeeds, the acquisition worked; if not, we
    loop again because the counter changed. If there were not enough tokens,
    we'll perform a futex-wait.

    Before we do, we set the high bit in the futex to indicate that semaphore
    is contended: that is, there's a thread waiting for more tokens. On
    release() for n tokens, we perform a fetch-and-add of n and then check if
    that high bit was set. If it was, then we clear that bit and perform a
    futex-wake on the semaphore to indicate the waiting threads can wake up and
    acquire tokens. Which ones get woken up is unspecified.

    If the system has the ability to wake up a precise number of threads, has
    Linux's FUTEX_WAKE_OP functionality, and is 64-bit, instead of using a
    single bit indicating a contended semaphore, we'll store the number of
    tokens *plus* total number of waiters in the high word. Additionally, all
    multi-token waiters will be waiting on that high word. So when releasing n
    tokens on those systems, we tell the kernel to wake up n single-token
    threads and all of the multi-token ones. Which threads get woken up is
    unspecified, but it's likely single-token threads will get woken up first.

    \class QSemaphoreReleaser
    \brief The QSemaphoreReleaser class provides exception-safe deferral of a QSemaphore::release() call.
    \since 5.10
    \ingroup thread
    \inmodule QtCore

    \reentrant

    QSemaphoreReleaser can be used wherever you would otherwise use
    QSemaphore::release(). Constructing a QSemaphoreReleaser defers the
    release() call on the semaphore until the QSemaphoreReleaser is
    destroyed (see
    \l{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii}{RAII pattern}).

    You can use this to reliably release a semaphore to avoid dead-lock
    in the face of exceptions or early returns:

    \code
    // ... do something that may throw or return early
    sem.release();
    \endcode

    If an early return is taken or an exception is thrown before the
    \c{sem.release()} call is reached, the semaphore is not released,
    possibly preventing the thread waiting in the corresponding
    \c{sem.acquire()} call from ever continuing execution.

    When using RAII instead:

    \code
    const QSemaphoreReleaser releaser(sem);
    // ... do something that may throw or early return
    // implicitly calls sem.release() here and at every other return in between
    \endcode

    this can no longer happen, because the compiler will make sure that
    the QSemaphoreReleaser destructor is always called, and therefore
    the semaphore is always released.

    QSemaphoreReleaser is move-enabled and can therefore be returned
    from functions to transfer responsibility for releasing a semaphore
    out of a function or a scope:

    \code
    { // some scope
        QSemaphoreReleaser releaser; // does nothing
        // ...
        if (someCondition) {
            releaser = QSemaphoreReleaser(sem);
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    } // conditionally calls sem.release(), depending on someCondition
    \endcode

    A QSemaphoreReleaser can be canceled by a call to cancel(). A canceled
    semaphore releaser will no longer call QSemaphore::release() in its
    destructor.

    Cancels this QSemaphoreReleaser such that the destructor will no longer
    call \c{semaphore()->release()}. Returns the value of semaphore()
    before this call. After this call, semaphore() will return \c nullptr.

    To enable again, assign a new QSemaphoreReleaser:

    \code
    releaser.cancel(); // avoid releasing old semaphore()
    releaser = QSemaphoreReleaser(sem, 42);
    // now will call sem.release(42) when 'releaser' is destroyed
    \endcode
