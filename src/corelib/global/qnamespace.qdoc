/*!
    \enum Qt::AlignmentFlag

    This enum type is used to describe alignment. It contains
    horizontal and vertical flags that can be combined to produce
    the required effect.

    The \l{TextElideMode} enum can also be used in many situations
    to fine-tune the appearance of aligned text.

    The horizontal flags are:

    \value AlignLeft Aligns with the left edge.
    \value AlignRight Aligns with the right edge.
    \value AlignHCenter Centers horizontally in the available space.
    \value AlignJustify Justifies the text in the available space.

    The vertical flags are:

    \value AlignTop Aligns with the top.
    \value AlignBottom Aligns with the bottom.
    \value AlignVCenter Centers vertically in the available space.
    \value AlignBaseline Aligns with the baseline.

    You can use only one of the horizontal flags at a time. There is
    one two-dimensional flag:

    \value AlignCenter Centers in both dimensions.

    You can use at most one horizontal and one vertical flag at a
    time. Qt::AlignCenter counts as both horizontal and vertical.

    Three enum values are useful in applications that can be run in
    right-to-left mode:

    \value AlignAbsolute  If the widget's layout direction is
        Qt::RightToLeft (instead of Qt::LeftToRight, the default),
        Qt::AlignLeft refers to the \e right edge and Qt::AlignRight
        to the \e left edge. This is normally the desired behavior.
        If you want Qt::AlignLeft to always mean "left" and
        Qt::AlignRight to always mean "right", combine the flag with
        Qt::AlignAbsolute.
    \value AlignLeading  Synonym for Qt::AlignLeft.
    \value AlignTrailing  Synonym for Qt::AlignRight.

    Masks:

    \value AlignHorizontal_Mask
    \value AlignVertical_Mask

    Conflicting combinations of flags have undefined meanings.

/*!
    \enum Qt::ApplicationAttribute

    This enum describes attributes that change the behavior of
    application-wide features. These are enabled and disabled using
    QCoreApplication::setAttribute(), and can be tested for with
    QCoreApplication::testAttribute().


    \value AA_DontShowIconsInMenus Actions with the Icon property won't be
           shown in any menus unless specifically set by the
           QAction::iconVisibleInMenu property.
           Menus that are currently open or menus already created in the native
           \macos menubar \e{may not} pick up a change in this attribute. Changes
           in the QAction::iconVisibleInMenu property will always be picked up.

    \value AA_DontShowShortcutsInContextMenus Actions with the Shortcut property
           won't be shown in any shortcut menus unless specifically set by the
           QAction::shortcutVisibleInContextMenu property. This value was added
           in Qt 5.10.

    \value AA_NativeWindows Ensures that widgets have native windows.

    \value AA_DontCreateNativeWidgetSiblings Ensures that siblings of native
           widgets stay non-native unless specifically set by the
           Qt::WA_NativeWindow attribute.

    \value AA_PluginApplication Indicates that Qt is used to author a plugin. Depending
           on the operating system, it suppresses specific initializations that do not
           necessarily make sense in the plugin case.
           For example on \macos, this includes avoiding loading our nib for the main
           menu and not taking possession of the native menu bar. Setting this
           attribute to true will also set the AA_DontUseNativeMenuBar attribute
           to true. It also disables native event filters.
           This attribute must be set before QGuiApplication constructed.
           This value was added in Qt 5.7.

    \value AA_DontUseNativeMenuBar All menubars created while this attribute is
           set to true won't be used as a native menubar (e.g, the menubar at
           the top of the main screen on \macos).

    \value AA_MacDontSwapCtrlAndMeta On \macos by default, Qt swaps the
           Control and Meta (Command) keys (i.e., whenever Control is pressed, Qt
           sends Meta, and whenever Meta is pressed Control is sent). When this
           attribute is true, Qt will not do the flip. \l QKeySequence::StandardKey
           will also flip accordingly (i.e., QKeySequence::Copy will be
           Command+C on the keyboard regardless of the value set, though what is output for
           QKeySequence::toString() will be different).

    \value AA_Use96Dpi Assume the screen has a resolution of 96 DPI rather
           than using the OS-provided resolution. This will cause font rendering
           to be consistent in pixels-per-point across devices rather than
           defining 1 point as 1/72 inch.

    \value AA_SynthesizeTouchForUnhandledMouseEvents All mouse events
           that are not accepted by the application will be translated
           to touch events instead.

    \value AA_SynthesizeMouseForUnhandledTouchEvents All touch events
           that are not accepted by the application will be translated
           to left button mouse events instead. This attribute is enabled
           by default.

    \value AA_UseHighDpiPixmaps Make QIcon::pixmap() generate high-dpi pixmaps
           that can be larger than the requested size. Such pixmaps will have
           \l {QPixmap::devicePixelRatio}{devicePixelRatio()} set to a value higher than 1.
           After setting this attribute, application code that uses pixmap
           sizes in layout geometry calculations should typically divide by
           \l {QPixmap::devicePixelRatio}{devicePixelRatio()} to get device-independent layout geometry.

    \value AA_ForceRasterWidgets Make top-level widgets use pure raster surfaces,
           and do not support non-native GL-based child widgets.

    \value AA_UseDesktopOpenGL Forces the usage of desktop OpenGL (for example,
           \e opengl32.dll or \e libGL.so) on platforms that use dynamic loading
           of the OpenGL implementation. This attribute must be set before
           QGuiApplication is constructed.
           This value was added in Qt 5.3.

    \value AA_UseOpenGLES Forces the usage of OpenGL ES 2.0 or higher on
           platforms that use dynamic loading of the OpenGL implementation.
           This attribute must be set before QGuiApplication is constructed.
           This value was added in Qt 5.3.

    \value AA_UseSoftwareOpenGL Forces the usage of a software based OpenGL
           implementation on platforms that use dynamic loading of the OpenGL
           implementation. This will typically be a patched build of
           \l{http://www.mesa3d.org/llvmpipe.html}{Mesa llvmpipe}, providing
           OpenGL 2.1. The value may have no effect if no such OpenGL
           implementation is available. The default name of this library is
           \c opengl32sw.dll and can be overridden by setting the environment
           variable \e QT_OPENGL_DLL. See the platform-specific pages, for
           instance \l{Qt for Windows}, for more information. This attribute
           must be set before QGuiApplication is constructed.
           This value was added in Qt 5.4.

    \value AA_ShareOpenGLContexts Enables resource sharing between the OpenGL
           contexts used by classes like QOpenGLWidget and QQuickWidget. This
           allows sharing OpenGL resources, like textures, between QOpenGLWidget
           instances that belong to different top-level windows. This attribute
           must be set before QGuiApplication is constructed.
           This value was added in Qt 5.4.

    \value AA_SetPalette Indicates whether a palette was explicitly set on the
           QGuiApplication. This value was added in Qt 5.5.

    \value AA_EnableHighDpiScaling Enables high-DPI scaling in Qt on supported
           platforms (see also \l{High DPI Displays}). Supported platforms are
           X11, Windows and Android. Enabling makes Qt scale the main (device
           independent) coordinate system according to display scale factors
           provided by the operating system. This corresponds to setting the
           QT_AUTO_SCREEN\unicode{0x200b}_SCALE_FACTOR environment variable to
           1. This attribute must be set before QGuiApplication is constructed.
           This value was added in Qt 5.6.

    \value AA_DisableHighDpiScaling Disables high-DPI scaling in Qt, exposing window
           system coordinates. Note that the window system may do its own scaling,
           so this does not guarantee that QPaintDevice::devicePixelRatio() will
           be equal to 1. In addition, scale factors set by QT_SCALE_FACTOR will not
           be affected. This corresponds to setting the
           QT_AUTO_SCREEN\unicode{0x200b}_SCALE_FACTOR environment variable to 0.
           This attribute must be set before QGuiApplication is constructed.
           This value was added in Qt 5.6.

    \value AA_UseStyleSheetPropagationInWidgetStyles By default, Qt Style Sheets
           disable regular QWidget palette and font propagation. When this flag
           is enabled, font and palette changes propagate as though the user had
           manually called the corresponding QWidget methods. See
           \l{The Style Sheet Syntax#Inheritance}{The Style Sheet Syntax - Inheritance}
           for more details.
           This value was added in Qt 5.7.

    \value AA_DontUseNativeDialogs All dialogs created while this attribute is
           set to true won't use the native dialogs provided by the platform.
           This value was added in Qt 5.7.

    \value AA_SynthesizeMouseForUnhandledTabletEvents All tablet events
           that are not accepted by the application will be translated
           to mouse events instead. This attribute is enabled
           by default.
           This value was added in Qt 5.7.

    \value AA_CompressHighFrequencyEvents Enables compression of certain frequent events.
           On the X11 windowing system, the default value is true, which means that
           QEvent::MouseMove, QEvent::TouchUpdate, and changes in window size and
           position will be combined whenever they occur more frequently than the
           application handles them, so that they don't accumulate and overwhelm the
           application later.
           On Windows 8 and above the default value is also true, but it only applies
           to touch events. Mouse and window events remain unaffected by this flag.
           On other platforms, the default is false.
           (In the future, the compression feature may be implemented across platforms.)
           You can test the attribute to see whether compression is enabled.
           If your application needs to handle all events with no compression,
           you can unset this attribute. Notice that input events from tablet devices
           will not be compressed. See AA_CompressTabletEvents if you want these to be
           compressed as well.
           This value was added in Qt 5.7.

    \value AA_CompressTabletEvents Enables compression of input events from tablet devices.
           Notice that AA_CompressHighFrequencyEvents must be true for events compression
           to be enabled, and that this flag extends the former to tablet events.
           Currently supported on the X11 windowing system, Windows 8 and above.
           The default value is false.
           This value was added in Qt 5.10.

    \value AA_DontCheckOpenGLContextThreadAffinity When making a context
           current using QOpenGLContext, do not check that the
           \l{QObject#Thread Affinity}{QObject thread affinity}
           of the QOpenGLContext object is the same thread calling
           \l{QOpenGLContext::makeCurrent}{makeCurrent()}.
           This value was added in Qt 5.8.

    \value AA_DisableShaderDiskCache Disables caching of shader program binaries
           on disk. By default Qt Quick, QPainter's OpenGL backend, and any
           application using QOpenGLShaderProgram with one of its
           \e addCacheableShaderFromSource overloads will employ a disk-based
           \l{Caching Program Binaries}{program binary cache} in either the shared
           or per-process cache storage location, on systems that support
           \e glProgramBinary(). In the unlikely event of this being problematic,
           set this attribute to disable all disk-based caching of shaders.

    \value AA_DisableWindowContextHelpButton Disables the WindowContextHelpButtonHint
           by default on Qt::Sheet and Qt::Dialog widgets. This hides the \gui ? button
           on Windows, which only makes sense if you use \l QWhatsThis functionality.
           This value was added in Qt 5.10. In Qt 6, WindowContextHelpButtonHint
           will not be set by default.

    The following values are deprecated or obsolete:

    \value AA_ImmediateWidgetCreation This attribute is no longer fully
           supported in Qt 5. It ensures that widgets are created
           as soon as they are constructed. By default, resources for
           widgets are allocated on demand to improve efficiency and
           minimize resource usage. Setting or clearing this attribute
           affects widgets constructed after the change. Setting it
           tells Qt to create toplevel windows immediately.
           Therefore, if it is important to minimize resource
           consumption, do not set this attribute.

    \value AA_MacPluginApplication This attribute has been deprecated.
           Use AA_PluginApplication instead.

    \value AA_MSWindowsUseDirect3DByDefault This value is obsolete and
           has no effect.

    \value AA_X11InitThreads This value is obsolete and has no effect.

    \omitvalue AA_AttributeCount

    \value TextSingleLine Treats all whitespace as spaces and prints just
           one line.
    \value TextDontClip If it's impossible to stay within the given bounds,
           it prints outside.
    \value TextExpandTabs Makes the U+0009 (ASCII tab) character move to
           the next tab stop.
    \value TextShowMnemonic Displays the string "\&P" as \underline{P}
           For an ampersand, use "\&\&".
    \value TextWordWrap Breaks lines at appropriate points, e.g. at word

    \value TextWrapAnywhere Breaks lines anywhere, even within words.
    \value TextHideMnemonic Same as Qt::TextShowMnemonic but doesn't draw
           the underlines.
    \value TextDontPrint Treat this text as "hidden" and don't print it.
    \value TextIncludeTrailingSpaces When this option is set,
           QTextLine::naturalTextWidth() and QTextLine::naturalTextRect() will
           return a value that includes the width of trailing spaces in the

    \enum Qt::ConnectionType

    This enum describes the types of connection that can be used
    between signals and slots. In particular, it determines whether a
    particular signal is delivered to a slot immediately or queued for
    delivery at a later time.

    \value AutoConnection
           \b (Default) If the receiver \l{QObject#Thread Affinity}{lives in} the
           thread that emits the signal, Qt::DirectConnection is used. Otherwise,
           Qt::QueuedConnection is used. The connection type is
           determined when the signal is emitted.

    \value DirectConnection
           The slot is invoked immediately when the signal is
           emitted. The slot is executed in the signalling thread.

    \value QueuedConnection
           The slot is invoked when control returns to the event loop
           of the receiver's thread. The slot is executed in the
           receiver's thread.

    \value BlockingQueuedConnection
           Same as Qt::QueuedConnection, except that the signalling thread blocks
           until the slot returns. This connection must \e not be used if the
           receiver lives in the signalling thread, or else the application
           will deadlock.

    \value UniqueConnection
           This is a flag that can be combined with any one of the above
           connection types, using a bitwise OR. When Qt::UniqueConnection is
           set, QObject::connect() will fail if the connection already exists
           (i.e. if the same signal is already connected to the same slot
           for the same pair of objects). This flag was introduced in Qt 4.6.

    With queued connections, the parameters must be of types that are
    known to Qt's meta-object system, because Qt needs to copy the
    arguments to store them in an event behind the scenes. If you try
    to use a queued connection and get the error message:

    \snippet code/doc_src_qnamespace.qdoc 0

    Call qRegisterMetaType() to register the data type before you
    establish the connection.

    When using signals and slots with multiple threads, see \l{Signals and Slots Across Threads}.

    \enum Qt::DateFormat

    \value TextDate The default Qt format, which includes the day and month name,

    string, "ddd MMM d yyyy". See QDate::toString() for more information.

    instead (or Qt::DefaultLocaleLongDate if you want long dates).

    \value LocalDate \e{This enum value is deprecated.} Use Qt::SystemLocaleShortDate

    \c{[ddd,] dd MMM yyyy hh:mm[:ss] +/-TZ} or \c{ddd MMM dd yyyy hh:mm[:ss] +/-TZ}
    for combined dates and times.

    \note For \c ISODate formats, each \c Y, \c M and \c D represents a single digit
    of the year, month and day used to specify the date. Each \c H, \c M and \c S

    The options marked "(default)" are set if no other values from

    Color/Mono preference (ignored for QBitmap):

           black and white pixels, the pixmap becomes monochrome.
    \value ColorOnly The pixmap is dithered/converted to the
           \l{QPixmap::defaultDepth()}{native display depth}.
    \value MonoOnly The pixmap becomes monochrome. If necessary,
           it is dithered using the chosen dithering algorithm.

    Dithering mode preference:

    \value DiffuseDither (default) - A high-quality dither using error diffusion.
    \value OrderedDither A faster, ordered dither.
    \value ThresholdDither No dithering; closest color is used.

    Dithering mode preference for 1-bit alpha masks:

    \value ThresholdAlphaDither (default) - No dithering.
    \value OrderedAlphaDither A faster, ordered dither.
    \value DiffuseAlphaDither A high-quality dither using error diffusion.
    \omitvalue NoAlpha

    Color matching versus dithering preference:

    \value PreferDither Always dither images when converting to smaller color-spaces.
    \value AvoidDither Only dither to indexed formats if the source image uses more
           different colors than the size of the color table of the destination format.
    \value AutoDither (default) - Only dither when down-converting to 1 or 8-bit indexed formats.

    \omitvalue ColorMode_Mask
    \omitvalue Dither_Mask
    \omitvalue AlphaDither_Mask
    \omitvalue DitherMode_Mask

    \value NoOpaqueDetection Do not check whether the image contains non-opaque
           pixels. Use this if you know that the image is semi-transparent and
           you want to avoid the overhead of checking the pixels in the image
           until a non-opaque pixel is found, or if you want the pixmap to
           retain an alpha channel for some other reason. If the image has no
           alpha channel this flag has no effect.

    \value NoFormatConversion Don't do any format conversions on the image.
           Can be useful when converting a QImage to a QPixmap for a one-time
           rendering operation for example. Note that a QPixmap not in the
           preferred format will be much slower as a paint device.

    \enum Qt::WidgetAttribute

    \keyword widget attributes

    This enum type is used to specify various widget attributes.
    Attributes are set and cleared with QWidget::setAttribute(), and
    queried with QWidget::testAttribute(), although some have special
    convenience functions which are mentioned below.

    \value WA_AcceptDrops Allows data from drag and drop operations
    to be dropped onto the widget (see QWidget::setAcceptDrops()).

    \value WA_AlwaysShowToolTips Enables tooltips for inactive windows.

    \value WA_ContentsPropagated This flag is superfluous and
    obsolete; it no longer has any effect. Since Qt 4.1, all widgets
    that do not set WA_PaintOnScreen propagate their contents.

    \value WA_CustomWhatsThis Indicates that the widget wants to
    continue operating normally in "What's This?" mode. This is set by the
    widget's author.

    \value WA_DeleteOnClose Makes Qt delete this widget when the
    widget has accepted the close event (see QWidget::closeEvent()).

    \value WA_Disabled Indicates that the widget is disabled, i.e.
    it does not receive any mouse or keyboard events. There is also a
    getter functions QWidget::isEnabled().  This is set/cleared by the
    Qt kernel.

    \value WA_DontShowOnScreen Indicates that the widget is hidden or is
    not a part of the viewable Desktop.

    \omitvalue WA_DropSiteRegistered
    \omitvalue WA_ForceAcceptDrops

    \value WA_ForceDisabled Indicates that the widget is
    explicitly disabled, i.e. it will remain disabled even when all
    its ancestors are set to the enabled state. This implies
    WA_Disabled. This is set/cleared by QWidget::setEnabled() and
    QWidget::setDisabled().

    \value WA_ForceUpdatesDisabled Indicates that updates are
    explicitly disabled for the widget; i.e. it will remain disabled
    even when all its ancestors are set to the updates-enabled state.
    This implies WA_UpdatesDisabled. This is set/cleared by
    QWidget::setUpdatesEnabled().

    \value WA_GroupLeader
        \e{This attribute has been deprecated.} Use QWidget::windowModality
        instead.

    \value WA_Hover Forces Qt to generate paint events when the mouse
    enters or leaves the widget. This feature is typically used when
    implementing custom styles; see the \l{widgets/styles}{Styles}
    example for details.

    \value WA_InputMethodEnabled Enables input methods for Asian languages.
    Must be set when creating custom text editing widgets.

    \value WA_KeyboardFocusChange Set on a toplevel window when
    the users changes focus with the keyboard (tab, backtab, or shortcut).

    \value WA_KeyCompression Enables key event compression if set,
    and disables it if not set. By default key compression is off, so
    widgets receive one key press event for each key press (or more,
    since autorepeat is usually on). If you turn it on and your
    program doesn't keep up with key input, Qt may try to compress key
    events so that more than one character can be processed in each
    event.
    For example, a word processor widget might receive 2, 3 or more
    characters in each QKeyEvent::text(), if the layout recalculation
    takes too long for the CPU.
    If a widget supports multiple character unicode input, it is
    always safe to turn the compression on.
    Qt performs key event compression only for printable characters.
    Qt::Modifier keys, cursor movement keys, function keys and
    miscellaneous action keys (e.g. Escape, Enter, Backspace,
    PrintScreen) will stop key event compression, even if there are
    more compressible key events available.
    Platforms other than Mac and X11 do not support this compression,
    in which case turning it on will have no effect.
    This is set/cleared by the widget's author.

    \value WA_LayoutOnEntireRect Indicates that the widget
    wants QLayout to operate on the entire QWidget::rect(), not only
    on QWidget::contentsRect(). This is set by the widget's author.

    \value WA_LayoutUsesWidgetRect Ignore the layout item rect from the style
    when laying out this widget with QLayout.

    \value WA_MacNoClickThrough This value is obsolete and has no effect.

    \value WA_MacOpaqueSizeGrip Indicates that the native Carbon size grip
    should be opaque instead of transparent (the default). This attribute
    is only applicable to \macos and is set by the widget's author.

    \value WA_MacShowFocusRect Indicates that this widget should get a
    QFocusFrame around it. Some widgets draw their own focus halo
    regardless of this attribute. Not that the QWidget::focusPolicy
    also plays the main role in whether something is given focus or
    not, this only controls whether or not this gets the focus
    frame. This attribute is only applicable to \macos.

    \value WA_MacNormalSize Indicates the widget should have the
    normal size for widgets in \macos. This attribute is only
    applicable to \macos.

    \value WA_MacSmallSize Indicates the widget should have the small
    size for widgets in \macos. This attribute is only applicable to
    \macos.

    \value WA_MacMiniSize Indicates the widget should have the mini
    size for widgets in \macos. This attribute is only applicable to
    \macos.

    \value WA_MacVariableSize Indicates the widget can choose between
    alternative sizes for widgets to avoid clipping.
    This attribute is only applicable to \macos.

    \value WA_MacBrushedMetal This value is obsolete and has no effect.

    \omitvalue WA_MacMetalStyle

    \value WA_Mapped Indicates that the widget is mapped on screen.
    This is set/cleared by the Qt kernel.

    \value WA_MouseNoMask Makes the widget receive mouse events for
    the entire widget regardless of the currently set mask,
    overriding QWidget::setMask(). This is not applicable for
    top-level windows.

    \value WA_MouseTracking Indicates that the widget has mouse
    tracking enabled. See QWidget::mouseTracking.

    \value WA_Moved Indicates that the widget has an explicit
    position. This is set/cleared by QWidget::move() and
    by QWidget::setGeometry().

    \value WA_MSWindowsUseDirect3D This value is obsolete and has no
    effect.

    \value WA_NoBackground This value is obsolete. Use
    WA_OpaquePaintEvent instead.

    \value WA_NoChildEventsForParent Indicates that the widget does
    not want ChildAdded or ChildRemoved events sent to its
    parent. This is rarely necessary but can help to avoid automatic
    insertion widgets like splitters and layouts. This is set by a
    widget's author.

    \value WA_NoChildEventsFromChildren Indicates that the widget does
    not want to receive ChildAdded or ChildRemoved events sent from its
    children. This is set by a widget's author.

    \value WA_NoMouseReplay Used for pop-up widgets. Indicates that the most
    recent mouse press event should not be replayed when the pop-up widget
    closes. The flag is set by the widget's author and cleared by the Qt kernel
    every time the widget receives a new mouse event.

    \value WA_NoMousePropagation Prohibits mouse events from being propagated
    to the widget's parent. This attribute is disabled by default.

    \value WA_TransparentForMouseEvents When enabled, this attribute disables
    the delivery of mouse events to the widget and its children. Mouse events
    are delivered to other widgets as if the widget and its children were not
    present in the widget hierarchy; mouse clicks and other events effectively
    "pass through" them. This attribute is disabled by default.

    \value WA_NoSystemBackground Indicates that the widget has no background,
    i.e. when the widget receives paint events, the background is not
    automatically repainted. \b Note: Unlike WA_OpaquePaintEvent, newly exposed
    areas are \b never filled with the background (e.g., after showing a
    window for the first time the user can see "through" it until the
    application processes the paint events). This flag is set or cleared by the
    widget's author.

    \value WA_OpaquePaintEvent Indicates that the widget paints all its pixels
    when it receives a paint event. Thus, it is not required for operations
    like updating, resizing, scrolling and focus changes to erase the widget
    before generating paint events. The use of WA_OpaquePaintEvent provides a
    small optimization by helping to reduce flicker on systems that do not
    support double buffering and avoiding computational cycles necessary to
    erase the background prior to painting. \b Note: Unlike
    WA_NoSystemBackground, WA_OpaquePaintEvent makes an effort to avoid
    transparent window backgrounds. This flag is set or cleared by the widget's
    author.

    \value WA_OutsideWSRange Indicates that the widget is outside
    the valid range of the window system's coordinate system. A widget
    outside the valid range cannot be mapped on screen. This is
    set/cleared by the Qt kernel.

    \value WA_PaintOnScreen Indicates that the widget wants to draw directly
    onto the screen. Widgets with this attribute set do not participate in
    composition management, i.e. they cannot be semi-transparent or shine
    through semi-transparent overlapping widgets. \b Note: This flag is only
    supported on X11 and it disables double buffering. On Qt for Embedded
    Linux, the flag only works when set on a top-level widget and it relies on
    support from the active screen driver. This flag is set or cleared by the
    widget's author. To render outside of Qt's paint system, e.g., if you
    require native painting primitives, you need to reimplement
    QWidget::paintEngine() to return 0 and set this flag.

    \value WA_PaintUnclipped Makes all painters operating on this widget
    unclipped. Children of this widget or other widgets in front of it do not
    clip the area the painter can paint on. This flag is only supported for
    widgets with the WA_PaintOnScreen flag set. The preferred way to do this in
    a cross platform way is to create a transparent widget that lies in front
    of the other widgets.

    \value WA_PendingMoveEvent Indicates that a move event is pending, e.g.,
    when a hidden widget was moved. This flag is set or cleared by the Qt
    kernel.

    \value WA_PendingResizeEvent Indicates that a resize event is pending,
    e.g., when a hidden widget was resized. This flag is set or cleared by the
    Qt kernel.

    \value WA_QuitOnClose Makes Qt quit the application when the last widget
    with the attribute set has accepted closeEvent(). This behavior can be
    modified with the QApplication::quitOnLastWindowClosed property. By default
    this attribute is set for all widgets of type Qt::Window.

    \value WA_Resized Indicates that the widget has an explicit size. This flag
    is set or cleared by QWidget::resize() and QWidget::setGeometry().

    \value WA_RightToLeft Indicates that the layout direction for the widget
    is right to left.

    \value WA_SetCursor Indicates that the widget has a cursor of its own. This
    flag is set or cleared by QWidget::setCursor() and QWidget::unsetCursor().

    \value WA_SetFont Indicates that the widget has a font of its own. This
    flag is set or cleared by QWidget::setFont().

    \value WA_SetPalette Indicates that the widget has a palette of its own.
    This flag is set or cleared by QWidget::setPalette().

    \value WA_SetStyle Indicates that the widget has a style of its own. This
    flag is set or cleared by QWidget::setStyle().

    \value WA_ShowModal \e{This attribute has been deprecated.} Use
    QWidget::windowModality instead.

    \value WA_StaticContents Indicates that the widget contents are north-west
    aligned and static. On resize, such a widget will receive paint events only
    for parts of itself that are newly visible. This flag is set or cleared by
    the widget's author.

    \value WA_StyleSheet Indicates that the widget is styled using a
    \l{Qt Style Sheets}{style sheet}. WA_StyleSheet is set whenever a widget
    is subject to a style sheet, even if the style sheet did not affect the
    widget appearance.

    \value WA_StyleSheetTarget Indicates that the widget appearance was modified
    by a \l{Qt Style Sheets}{style sheet}. WA_StyleSheet will also be set.

    \value WA_TabletTracking Indicates that the widget has tablet
    tracking enabled. See QWidget::tabletTracking.

    \value WA_TranslucentBackground Indicates that the widget should have a
    translucent background, i.e., any non-opaque regions of the widgets will be
    translucent because the widget will have an alpha channel. Setting this
    flag causes WA_NoSystemBackground to be set. On Windows the
    widget also needs the Qt::FramelessWindowHint window flag to be set.
    This flag is set or cleared by the widget's author.

    \value WA_UnderMouse Indicates that the widget is under the mouse cursor.
    The value is not updated correctly during drag and drop operations. There
    is also a getter function, QWidget::underMouse(). This flag is set or
    cleared by the Qt kernel.

    \value WA_UpdatesDisabled Indicates that updates are blocked (including the
    system background). This flag is set or cleared by the Qt kernel.
    \b Warning: This flag must \e never be set or cleared by the widget's author.

    \value WA_WindowModified Indicates that the window is marked as modified.
    On some platforms this flag will do nothing, on others (including \macos
    and Windows) the window will take a modified appearance. This flag is set
    or cleared by QWidget::setWindowModified().

    \value WA_WindowPropagation Makes a toplevel window inherit font, palette
    and locale from its parent.

    \value WA_MacAlwaysShowToolWindow On \macos, show the tool window even
    when the application is not active.  By default, all tool windows are
    hidden when the application is inactive.

    \value WA_SetLocale Indicates the locale should be taken into consideration
    in the widget.

    \value WA_StyledBackground Indicates the widget should be drawn using a
    styled background.

    \value WA_ShowWithoutActivating Show the widget without making it active.

    \value WA_NativeWindow Indicates that a native window is created for the
    widget. Enabling this flag will also force a native window for the widget's
    ancestors unless Qt::WA_DontCreateNativeAncestors is set.

    \value WA_DontCreateNativeAncestors Indicates that the widget's ancestors
    are kept non-native even though the widget itself is native.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeDesktop Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP to the
    window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeToolBar Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLBAR to the
    window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute
    has no effect on non-X11 platforms. \b Note: Qt automatically sets this
    attribute for QToolBar.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeMenu Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_MENU to the
    window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See

    to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This
    attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. \b Note: Qt automatically sets
    this attribute for the Qt::Dialog and Qt::Sheet window types.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeDropDownMenu Adds
    _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DROPDOWN_MENU to the window's
    _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This
    attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. \b Note: Qt
    automatically sets this attribute for QMenu objects added to a QMenuBar.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypePopupMenu Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_POPUP_MENU
    to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute
    has no effect on non-X11 platforms. \b Note: Qt automatically sets this
    attribute for QMenu.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeToolTip Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLTIP to the
    window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute
    has no effect on non-X11 platforms. \b Note: Qt automatically sets this
    attribute for the Qt::ToolTip window type.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeNotification Adds
    _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NOTIFICATION to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11
    window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more
    details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeCombo Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_COMBO
    to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute
    has no effect on non-X11 platforms. \b Note: Qt automatically sets this
    attribute for the QComboBox pop-up.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeDND Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DND to
    the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute
    has no effect on non-X11 platforms. \b Note: Qt automatically sets this
    attribute on the feedback widget used during a drag.

    \value WA_MacFrameworkScaled This value is obsolete and has no effect.

    \value WA_AcceptTouchEvents Allows touch events (see QTouchEvent)
    to be sent to the widget. Must be set on all widgets that can
    handle touch events. Without this attribute set, events from a
    touch device will be sent as mouse events.

    \value WA_TouchPadAcceptSingleTouchEvents Allows touchpad single
    touch events to be sent to the widget.

    \value WA_X11DoNotAcceptFocus Asks the window manager to not give focus
    to this top level window. This attribute has no effect on non-X11
    platforms.

    \value WA_AlwaysStackOnTop Since Qt 5.4, this value forces QOpenGLWidget and
    QQuickWidget to be drawn last, on top of other widgets. Ignored for other
    type of widgets. Setting this attribute breaks the stacking order, but
    allows having a semi-transparent OpenGL widget with other widgets visible
    underneath. It is strongly recommended to call update() on the widget's
    top-level window after enabling or disabling this attribute.

    \value WA_ContentsMarginsRespectsSafeArea A QWidget respects the safe
    area margins of a window by incorporating the margins into its contents'
    margins by default. This means, that a QLayout will use the content area
    of a widget for its layout, unless the Qt::WA_LayoutOnEntireRect attribute
    is set. This along with a contents margin of 0 can be used on the actual
    layout, to allow for example a background image to underlay the status bar and other
    system areas on an iOS device, while still allowing child widgets of
    that background to be inset based on the safe area.

                                   (e.g. when low memory forces the OS to purge suspended applications).
    \value ApplicationHidden       The application is hidden and runs in the background. This
                                   is the normal state for applications that need to do background
                                   processing, like playing music, while the user interacts with
                                   other applications. The application should free up all graphical

    \value ApplicationInactive     The application is visible, but not selected to be in front.
                                   On desktop platforms, this typically means that the user
                                   activated another application. On mobile platforms, it is
                                   more common to enter this state when the OS is interrupting

/*!
    \enum Qt::WindowType

    \keyword window flag

    This enum type is used to specify various window-system properties
    for the widget. They are fairly unusual but necessary in a few
    cases. Some of these flags depend on whether the underlying window
    manager supports them.

    The main types are

    \value Widget  This is the default type for QWidget. Widgets of
                   this type are child widgets if they have a parent,
                   and independent windows if they have no parent.
                   See also Qt::Window and Qt::SubWindow.

    \value Window  Indicates that the widget is a window, usually
                   with a window system frame and a title bar,
                   irrespective of whether the widget has a parent or
                   not. Note that it is not possible to unset this
                   flag if the widget does not have a parent.

    \value Dialog  Indicates that the widget is a window that should
                   be decorated as a dialog (i.e., typically no
                   maximize or minimize buttons in the title bar).
                   This is the default type for QDialog. If you want
                   to use it as a modal dialog, it should be launched
                   from another window, or have a parent and used
                   with the QWidget::windowModality property. If you make
                   it modal, the dialog will prevent other top-level
                   windows in the application from getting any input.
                   We refer to a top-level window that has a parent
                   as a \e secondary window.

    \value Sheet   Indicates that the window is a sheet on \macos. Since
                   using a sheet implies window modality, the recommended
                   way is to use QWidget::setWindowModality(), or
                   QDialog::open(), instead.

    \value Drawer  Indicates that the widget is a drawer on \macos.

    \value Popup   Indicates that the widget is a pop-up top-level
                   window, i.e. that it is modal, but has a window
                   system frame appropriate for pop-up menus.

    \value Tool    Indicates that the widget is a tool window. A tool
                   window is often a small window with a smaller than
                   usual title bar and decoration, typically used for
                   collections of tool buttons. If there is a parent,
                   the tool window will always be kept on top of it.
                   If there isn't a parent, you may consider using
                   Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint as well. If the window
                   system supports it, a tool window can be decorated
                   with a somewhat lighter frame. It can also be
                   combined with Qt::FramelessWindowHint.
                   On \macos, tool windows correspond to the
                   \l{https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspanel}{NSPanel}
                   class of windows. This means that the window lives on a
                   level above normal windows making it impossible to put a normal
                   window on top of it. By default, tool windows will disappear
                   when the application is inactive.  This can be controlled by
                   the Qt::WA_MacAlwaysShowToolWindow attribute.

    \value ToolTip Indicates that the widget is a tooltip. This is
                   used internally to implement
                   \l{QWidget::toolTip}{tooltips}.

    \value SplashScreen Indicates that the window is a splash screen.
                        This is the default type for QSplashScreen.

    \value Desktop  Indicates that this widget is the desktop. This
                    is the type for QDesktopWidget.

    \value SubWindow  Indicates that this widget is a sub-window, such
                      as a QMdiSubWindow widget.

    \value ForeignWindow Indicates that this window object is a handle
                         representing a native platform window created by
                         another process or by manually using native code.

    \value CoverWindow Indicates that the window represents a cover window,
                       which is shown when the application is minimized on
                       some platforms.

    There are also a number of flags which you can use to customize
    the appearance of top-level windows. These have no effect on other
    windows:

    \value MSWindowsFixedSizeDialogHint  Gives the window a thin dialog border on Windows.
           This style is traditionally used for fixed-size dialogs.

    \value MSWindowsOwnDC  Gives the window its own display
           context on Windows.

    \value BypassWindowManagerHint This flag can be used to indicate to the platform plugin
           that "all" window manager protocols should be disabled. This flag will behave
           different depending on what operating system the application is running on and
           what window manager is running. The flag can be used to get a native window
           with no configuration set.

    \value X11BypassWindowManagerHint  Bypass the window
           manager completely. This results in a borderless window
           that is not managed at all (i.e., no keyboard input unless
           you call QWidget::activateWindow() manually).

    \value FramelessWindowHint  Produces a borderless window.
           The user cannot move or resize a borderless window via the window
           system. On X11, the result of the flag is dependent on the window manager and its
           ability to understand Motif and/or NETWM hints. Most existing
           modern window managers can handle this.

    \value NoDropShadowWindowHint  Disables window drop shadow on supporting platforms.

    The \c CustomizeWindowHint flag is used to enable customization of
    the window controls. This flag must be set to allow the \c
    WindowTitleHint, \c WindowSystemMenuHint, \c
    WindowMinimizeButtonHint, \c WindowMaximizeButtonHint and \c
    WindowCloseButtonHint flags to be changed.

    \value CustomizeWindowHint  Turns off the default window title hints.

    \value WindowTitleHint  Gives the window a title bar.

    \value WindowSystemMenuHint Adds a window system menu, and
    possibly a close button (for example on Mac). If you need to hide
    or show a close button, it is more portable to use \c
    WindowCloseButtonHint.

    \value WindowMinimizeButtonHint  Adds a minimize button. On
           some platforms this implies Qt::WindowSystemMenuHint for it to work.

    \value WindowMaximizeButtonHint  Adds a maximize button. On
           some platforms this implies Qt::WindowSystemMenuHint for it to work.

    \value WindowMinMaxButtonsHint  Adds a minimize and a maximize
           button. On some platforms this implies Qt::WindowSystemMenuHint for it to work.

    \value WindowCloseButtonHint  Adds a close button. On
           some platforms this implies Qt::WindowSystemMenuHint for it
           to work.

    \value WindowContextHelpButtonHint  Adds a context help button to dialogs.
           On some platforms this implies Qt::WindowSystemMenuHint for it to work.

    \value MacWindowToolBarButtonHint On \macos adds a tool bar button (i.e.,
           the oblong button that is on the top right of windows that have toolbars).

    \value WindowFullscreenButtonHint On \macos adds a fullscreen button.

    \value BypassGraphicsProxyWidget Prevents the window and its children from
           automatically embedding themselves into a QGraphicsProxyWidget if the
           parent widget is already embedded. You can set this flag if you
           want your widget to always be a toplevel widget on the desktop,
           regardless of whether the parent widget is embedded in a scene or
           not.

    \value WindowShadeButtonHint Adds a shade button in place of the minimize
           button if the underlying window manager supports it.

    \value WindowStaysOnTopHint  Informs the window system that the
           window should stay on top of all other windows. Note that
           on some window managers on X11 you also have to pass
           Qt::X11BypassWindowManagerHint for this flag to work
           correctly.

    \value WindowStaysOnBottomHint Informs the window system that the
           window should stay on bottom of all other windows.

           \note On X11, this hint will work only in window managers
           that support _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW atom. If a window always

    \value WindowTransparentForInput Informs the window system that this window
           is used only for output (displaying something) and does not take input.
           Therefore input events should pass through as if it wasn't there.

    \value WindowOverridesSystemGestures Informs the window system that this window
           implements its own set of gestures and that system level gestures, like for
           instance three-finger desktop switching, should be disabled.

           not receive the input focus.

    \value MaximizeUsingFullscreenGeometryHint Informs the window system that when
           maximizing the window it should use as much of the available screen geometry
           as possible, including areas that may be covered by system UI such as status
           bars or application launchers. This may result in the window being placed
           under these system UIs, but does not guarantee it, depending on whether or
           not the platform supports it. When the flag is enabled the user is responsible
           for taking QScreen::availableGeometry() into account, so that any UI elements
           in the application that require user interaction are not covered by system UI.

    \value WindowType_Mask  A mask for extracting the window type

    it, each with its own role. The roles are used by the view to indicate
    to the model which type of data it needs. Custom models should return
    data in these types.

    The general purpose roles (and the associated types) are:

    \value DisplayRole    The key data to be rendered in the form of text. (QString)
    \value DecorationRole The data to be rendered as a decoration in the form
                          of an icon. (QColor, QIcon or QPixmap)
    \value EditRole       The data in a form suitable for editing in an
                          editor. (QString)
    \value ToolTipRole    The data displayed in the item's tooltip. (QString)
    \value StatusTipRole  The data displayed in the status bar. (QString)
    \value WhatsThisRole  The data displayed for the item in "What's This?"
                          mode. (QString)
    \value SizeHintRole   The size hint for the item that will be supplied
                          to views. (QSize)

    Roles describing appearance and meta data (with associated types):

    \value FontRole             The font used for items rendered with the default
                                delegate. (QFont)
    \value TextAlignmentRole    The alignment of the text for items rendered with the
                                default delegate. (Qt::Alignment)
    \value BackgroundRole       The background brush used for items rendered with
                                the default delegate. (QBrush)
    \value BackgroundColorRole  This role is obsolete. Use BackgroundRole instead.
    \value ForegroundRole       The foreground brush (text color, typically)
                                used for items rendered with the default delegate.
                                (QBrush)
    \value TextColorRole        This role is obsolete. Use ForegroundRole instead.
    \value CheckStateRole       This role is used to obtain the checked state of
                                an item. (Qt::CheckState)
    \value InitialSortOrderRole This role is used to obtain the initial sort order
                                of a header view section. (Qt::SortOrder). This
                                role was introduced in Qt 4.8.

    Accessibility roles (with associated types):

    \value AccessibleTextRole        The text to be used by accessibility
                                     extensions and plugins, such as screen
                                     readers. (QString)
    \value AccessibleDescriptionRole A description of the item for accessibility
                                     purposes. (QString)

    User roles:

    \value UserRole       The first role that can be used for application-specific purposes.

    \omitvalue DisplayPropertyRole
    \omitvalue DecorationPropertyRole
    \omitvalue ToolTipPropertyRole
    \omitvalue StatusTipPropertyRole
    \omitvalue WhatsThisPropertyRole

    For user roles, it is up to the developer to decide which types to use and ensure that
    components use the correct types when accessing and setting data.

    \enum Qt::ItemFlag

    This enum describes the properties of an item:

    \value NoItemFlags It does not have any properties set.
    \value ItemIsSelectable It can be selected.
    \value ItemIsEditable It can be edited.
    \value ItemIsDragEnabled It can be dragged.
    \value ItemIsDropEnabled It can be used as a drop target.
    \value ItemIsUserCheckable It can be checked or unchecked by the user.
    \value ItemIsEnabled The user can interact with the item.
    \value ItemIsAutoTristate The item's state depends on the state of its children.
           This enables automatic management of the state of parent items in QTreeWidget
           (checked if all children are checked, unchecked if all children are unchecked,
           or partially checked if only some children are checked).
    \value ItemIsTristate \e{This enum value is deprecated.} Use Qt::ItemIsAutoTristate
    instead.
    \value ItemNeverHasChildren The item never has child items.
           This is used for optimization purposes only.
    \value ItemIsUserTristate The user can cycle through three separate states.
           This value was added in Qt 5.5.

    Note that checkable items need to be given both a suitable set of flags
    and an initial state, indicating whether the item is checked or not.
    This is handled automatically for model/view components, but needs
    to be explicitly set for instances of QListWidgetItem, QTableWidgetItem,
    and QTreeWidgetItem.

    Note that it is undefined behavior to reimplement QAbstractItemModel::hasChildren
    to return true for an index if that index has the Qt::ItemNeverHasChildren flag set.

    \value MatchRegExp      Performs string-based matching using a regular
           expression as the search term.
    \value MatchWildcard    Performs string-based matching using a string with
           wildcards as the search term.
    \value MatchWrap        Perform a search that wraps around, so that when
           the search reaches the last item in the model, it begins again at
           the first item and continues until all items have been examined.
    \value MatchRecursive   Searches the entire hierarchy.

    \value CoarseTimer Coarse timers try to keep accuracy within 5% of the desired interval
    \value VeryCoarseTimer Very coarse timers only keep full second accuracy

    On UNIX (including Linux, \macos, and iOS), Qt will keep millisecond accuracy
    for Qt::PreciseTimer. For Qt::CoarseTimer, the interval will be adjusted up
    to 5% to align the timer with other timers that are expected to fire at or
    around the same time. The objective is to make most timers wake up at the
    same time, thereby reducing CPU wakeups and power consumption.

    On Windows, Qt will use Windows's Multimedia timer facility (if available)
    for Qt::PreciseTimer and normal Windows timers for Qt::CoarseTimer and
    Qt::VeryCoarseTimer.

    On all platforms, the interval for Qt::VeryCoarseTimer is rounded to the
