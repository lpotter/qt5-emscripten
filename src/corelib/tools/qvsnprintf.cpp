    \relates QByteArray

    A portable \c vsnprintf() function. Will call \c ::vsnprintf(), \c
    ::_vsnprintf(), or \c ::vsnprintf_s depending on the system, or
    fall back to an internal version.

    \a fmt is the \c printf() format string. The result is put into
    \a str, which is a buffer of at least \a n bytes.

    The caller is responsible to call \c va_end() on \a ap.

    \warning Since vsnprintf() shows different behavior on certain
    platforms, you should not rely on the return value or on the fact
    that you will always get a 0 terminated string back.

    Ideally, you should never call this function but use QString::asprintf()
    instead.
