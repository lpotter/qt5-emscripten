    \class QCollator

    \brief The QCollator class compares strings according to a localized collation algorithm.

    \since 5.2

    \reentrant
    \ingroup i18n
    \ingroup string-processing
    \ingroup shared

    QCollator is initialized with a QLocale and an optional collation strategy. It tries to
    initialize the collator with the specified values. The collator can then be used to compare
    and sort strings in a locale dependent fashion.

    A QCollator object can be used together with template based sorting algorithms such as std::sort
    to sort a list of QStrings.

    In addition to the locale and collation strategy, several optional flags can be set that influence
    the result of the collation.
