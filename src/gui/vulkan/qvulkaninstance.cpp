    \class QVulkanInstance
    \since 5.10
    \inmodule QtGui

    \brief The QVulkanInstance class represents a native Vulkan instance, enabling
    Vulkan rendering onto a QSurface.

    \l{https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/}{Vulkan} is a cross-platform, explicit
    graphics and compute API. This class provides support for loading a Vulkan
    library and creating an \c instance in a cross-platform manner. For an
    introduction on Vulkan instances, refer
    \l{https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/html/vkspec.html#initialization-instances}{to
    section 3.2 of the specification}.

    \note Platform-specific support for Vulkan instances and windows with
    Vulkan-capable surfaces is provided by the various platform plugins. Not
    all of them will support Vulkan, however. When running on such a platform,
    create() will fail and always return \c false.

    \note Vulkan support may get automatically disabled for a given Qt build due
    to not having the necessary Vulkan headers available at build time. When
    this is the case, and the output of \c configure indicates Vulkan support is
    disabled, the QVulkan* classes will be unavailable.

    \note Some functions changed their signature between the various Vulkan
    header revisions. When building Qt and only headers with the old,
    conflicting signatures are present in a system, Vulkan support will get
    disabled. It is recommended to use headers from Vulkan 1.0.39 or newer.

    \section1 Initialization

    Similarly to QOpenGLContext, any actual Vulkan instance creation happens
    only when calling create(). This allows using QVulkanInstance as a plain
    member variable while retaining control over when to perform
    initialization.

    Querying the supported instance-level layers and extensions is possible by
    calling supportedLayers() and supportedExtensions(). These ensure the
    Vulkan library is loaded, and can therefore be called safely before
    create() as well.

    Instances store per-application Vulkan state and creating a \c VkInstance
    object initializes the Vulkan library. In practice there will typically be
    a single instance constructed early on in main(). The object then stays
    alive until exiting the application.

    Every Vulkan-based QWindow must be associated with a QVulkanInstance by
    calling QWindow::setVulkanInstance(). Thus a typical application pattern is
    the following:

    \code
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        QGuiApplication app(argc, argv);

        QVulkanInstance inst;
        if (!inst.create())
            return 1;

        ...
        window->setVulkanInstance(&inst);
        window->show();

        return app.exec();
    }
    \endcode

    \section1 Configuration

    QVulkanInstance automatically enables the minimum set of extensions it
    needs on the newly created instance. In practice this means the
    \c{VK_KHR_*_surface} family of extensions.

    By default Vulkan debug output, for example messages from the validation
    layers, is routed to qDebug(). This can be disabled by passing the flag
    \c NoDebugOutputRedirect to setFlags() \e before invoking create().

    To enable additional layers and extensions, provide the list via
    setLayers() and setExtensions() \e before invoking create(). When a
    given layer or extension is not reported as available from the instance,
    the request is ignored. After a successful call to create(), the values
    returned from functions like layers() and extensions() reflect the actual
    enabled layers and extensions. When necessary, for example to avoid
    requesting extensions that conflict and thus would fail the Vulkan instance
    creation, the list of actually supported layers and extensions can be
    examined via supportedLayers() and supportedExtensions() before calling
    create().

    For example, to enable the standard validation layers, one could do the
    following:

    \code
        QVulkanInstance inst;

        // Enable validation layer, if supported. Messages go to qDebug by default.
        inst.setLayers(QByteArrayList() << "VK_LAYER_LUNARG_standard_validation");

        bool ok = inst.create();
        if (!ok)
            ... // Vulkan not available
        if (!inst.layers().contains("VK_LAYER_LUNARG_standard_validation"))
            ... // validation layer not available
    \endcode

    Or, alternatively, to make decisions before attempting to create a Vulkan
    instance:

    \code
        QVulkanInstance inst;

        if (inst.supportedLayers().contains("VK_LAYER_LUNARG_standard_validation"))
            ...

        bool ok = inst.create();
        ...
    \endcode

    \section1 Adopting an Existing Instance

    By default QVulkanInstance creates a new Vulkan instance. When working with
    external engines and renderers, this may sometimes not be desirable. When
    there is a \c VkInstance handle already available, call setVkInstance()
    before invoking create(). This way no additional instances will get
    created, and QVulkanInstance will not own the handle.

    \note It is up to the component creating the external instance to ensure
    the necessary extensions are enabled on it. These are: \c{VK_KHR_surface},
    the WSI-specific \c{VK_KHR_*_surface} that is appropriate for the platform
    in question, and \c{VK_EXT_debug_report} in case QVulkanInstance's debug
    output redirection is desired.

    \section1 Accessing Core Vulkan Commands

    To access the \c VkInstance handle the QVulkanInstance wraps, call
    vkInstance(). To resolve Vulkan functions, call getInstanceProcAddr(). For
    core Vulkan commands manual resolving is not necessary as they are provided
    via the QVulkanFunctions and QVulkanDeviceFunctions objects accessible via
    functions() and deviceFunctions().

    \note QVulkanFunctions and QVulkanDeviceFunctions are generated from the
    Vulkan API XML specifications when building the Qt libraries. Therefore no
    documentation is provided for them. They contain the Vulkan 1.0 functions
    with the same signatures as described in the
    \l{https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/html/}{Vulkan API
    documentation}.

    \section1 Getting a Native Vulkan Surface for a Window

    The two common windowing system specific operations are getting a surface
    (a \c{VkSurfaceKHR} handle) for a window, and querying if a given queue
    family supports presenting to a given surface. To avoid WSI-specific bits
    in the applications, these are abstracted by QVulkanInstance and the
    underlying QPA layers.

    To create a Vulkan surface for a window, or retrieve an existing one,
    call surfaceForWindow(). Most platforms will only create the surface via
    \c{VK_KHR_*_surface} when first calling surfaceForWindow(), but there may be
    platform-specific variations in the internal behavior. Once created,
    subsequent calls to surfaceForWindow() just return the same handle. This
    fits the structure of typical Vulkan-enabled QWindow subclasses well.

    To query if a given queue family within a physical device can be used to
    perform presentation to a given surface, call supportsPresent(). This
    encapsulates both the generic \c vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR and
    the WSI-specific \c{vkGetPhysicalDevice*PresentationSupportKHR} checks.

    \section1 Troubleshooting

    Besides returning \c false from create() or \c 0 from surfaceForWindow(),
    critical errors will also get printed to the debug output via qWarning().
    Additional logging can be requested by enabling debug output for the
    logging category \c{qt.vulkan}. The actual Vulkan error code from instance
    creation can be retrieved by calling errorCode() after a failing create().

    In some special cases it may be necessary to override the Vulkan
    library name. This can be achieved by setting the \c{QT_VULKAN_LIB}
    environment variable.

    \section1 Example

    The following is the basic outline of creating a Vulkan-capable QWindow:

    \code
    class VulkanWindow : public QWindow
    {
    public:
        VulkanWindow() {
            setSurfaceType(VulkanSurface);
        }

        void exposeEvent(QExposeEvent *) {
            if (isExposed()) {
                if (!m_initialized) {
                    m_initialized = true;
                    // initialize device, swapchain, etc.
                    QVulkanInstance *inst = vulkanInstance();
                    QVulkanFunctions *f = inst->functions();
                    uint32_t devCount = 0;
                    f->vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(inst->vkInstance(), &devCount, nullptr);
                    ...
                    // build the first frame
                    render();
                }
            }
        }

        bool event(QEvent *e) {
            if (e->type == QEvent::UpdateRequest)
                render();
            return QWindow::event(e);
        }

        void render() {
           ...
           requestUpdate(); // render continuously
        }

    private:
        bool m_initialized = false;
    };

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        QGuiApplication app(argc, argv);

        QVulkanInstance inst;
        if (!inst.create()) {
            qWarning("Vulkan not available");
            return 1;
        }

        VulkanWindow window;
        window.showMaximized();

        return app.exec();

    }
    \endcode

    \note In addition to expose, a well-behaving window implementation will
    also have to take care of additional events like resize and
    QPlatformSurfaceEvent in order to ensure proper management of the
    swap chain. Additionally, some platforms may require releasing resources
    when not being exposed anymore.

    \section1 Using C++ Bindings for Vulkan

    Combining Qt's Vulkan enablers with a C++ Vulkan wrapper, for example
    \l{https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp}{Vulkan-Hpp}, is possible as
    well. The pre-requisite here is that the C++ layer must be able to adopt
    native handles (VkInstance, VkSurfaceKHR) in its classes without taking
    ownership (since the ownership stays with QVulkanInstance and QWindow).
    Consider also the following:

    \list

    \li Some wrappers require exception support to be enabled. Qt does not use
    exceptions. To enable exceptions for the application, add \c{CONFIG += exceptions}
    to the \c{.pro} file.

    \li Some wrappers call Vulkan functions directly, assuming \c{vulkan.h}
    provides prototypes and the application links to a Vulkan library exporting
    all necessary symbols. Qt may not directly link to a Vulkan library.
    Therefore, on some platforms it may be necessary to add
    \c{LIBS += -lvulkan} or similar in the application's \c{.pro} file.

    \li The headers for the QVulkan classes may include \c{vulkan.h} with
    \c{VK_NO_PROTOTYPES} enabled. This can cause issues in C++ wrapper headers
    that rely on the prototypes. Hence in application code it may be
    necessary to include \c{vulkan.hpp} or similar before any of the QVulkan
    headers.
