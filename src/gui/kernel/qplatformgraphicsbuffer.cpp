    \since 5.5
    \brief The QPlatformGraphicsBuffer is a windowsystem abstraction for native graphics buffers

    Different platforms have different ways of representing graphics buffers. On
    some platforms, it is possible to create one graphics buffer that you can bind
    to a texture and also get main memory access to the image bits. On the
    other hand, on some platforms all graphics buffer abstraction is completely
    hidden.

    QPlatformGraphicsBuffer is an abstraction of a single Graphics Buffer.

    There is no public constructor nor any public factory function.

    QPlatformGraphicsBuffer is intended to be created by using platform specific
    APIs available from QtPlatformHeaders, or there might be accessor functions
    similar to the accessor function that QPlatformBackingstore has.

    \enum QPlatformGraphicsBuffer::AccessType
