/*!
    \class QTouchDevice
    \brief The QTouchDevice class describes the device from which touch events originate.
    \since 5.0
    \ingroup touch
    \inmodule QtGui

    Each QTouchEvent contains a QTouchDevice pointer to allow accessing
    device-specific properties like type and capabilities. It is the
    responsibility of the platform or generic plug-ins to register the
    available touch devices via QWindowSystemInterface before generating any
    touch events. Applications do not need to instantiate this class, they
    should just access the global instances pointed to by QTouchEvent::device().
*/

/*! \enum QTouchDevice::DeviceType

    This enum represents the type of device that generated a QTouchEvent.

    \value TouchScreen In this type of device, the touch surface and display are integrated. This
                       means the surface and display typically have the same size, such that there
                       is a direct relationship between the touch points' physical positions and the
                       coordinate reported by QTouchEvent::TouchPoint. As a result, Qt allows the
                       user to interact directly with multiple QWidgets and QGraphicsItems at the
                       same time.

    \value TouchPad In this type of device, the touch surface is separate from the display. There
                    is not a direct relationship between the physical touch location and the
                    on-screen coordinates. Instead, they are calculated relative to the current
                    mouse position, and the user must use the touch-pad to move this reference
                    point. Unlike touch-screens, Qt allows users to only interact with a single
                    QWidget or QGraphicsItem at a time.
*/

/*! \enum QTouchDevice::CapabilityFlag

    This enum is used with QTouchDevice::capabilities() to indicate what kind of information the
    touch device or its driver can provide.

    \value Position Indicates that position information is available, meaning
                    that the pos() family of functions in the touch points return valid points.

    \value Area Indicates that touch area information is available, meaning that the rect() family
                of functions in the touch points return valid rectangles.

    \value Pressure Indicates that pressure information is available, meaning that pressure()
                    returns a valid value.

    \value Velocity Indicates that velocity information is available, meaning that velocity()
                    returns a valid vector.

    \value RawPositions Indicates that the list returned by QTouchEvent::TouchPoint::rawScreenPositions()
                        may contain one or more positions for each touch point. This is relevant when
                        the touch input gets filtered or corrected on driver level.

    \value NormalizedPosition Indicates that the normalized position is available, meaning that normalizedPos()
                              returns a valid value.

    \value MouseEmulation Indicates that the device synthesizes mouse events.
                          This enum value has been introduced in Qt 5.5.
