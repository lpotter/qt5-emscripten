    This is mainly useful for asynchronous systems like X11, where a window will be mapped to screen some
    time after being asked to show itself on the screen.

    Note that a window that is mapped to screen may still not be considered exposed if the window client
    area is completely covered by other windows, or if the window is otherwise not visible. This function
    will then time out when waiting for such a window.
