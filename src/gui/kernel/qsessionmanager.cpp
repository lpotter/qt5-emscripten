    \class QSessionManager
    \brief The QSessionManager class provides access to the session manager.

    \inmodule QtGui

    A session manager in a desktop environment (in which Qt GUI applications
    live) keeps track of a session, which is a group of running applications,
    each of which has a particular state. The state of an application contains
    (most notably) the documents the application has open and the position and
    size of its windows.

    The session manager is used to save the session, e.g., when the machine is
    shut down, and to restore a session, e.g., when the machine is started up.
    We recommend that you use QSettings to save an application's settings,
    for example, window positions, recently used files, etc. When the
    application is restarted by the session manager, you can restore the
    settings.

    QSessionManager provides an interface between the application and the
    platform's session manager. In Qt, session management requests for action
    are handled by the two signals QGuiApplication::commitDataRequest() and
    QGuiApplication::saveStateRequest(). Both provide a reference to a
    QSessionManager object as argument. The session manager can only be
    accessed in slots invoked by these signals.

    \warning If you use QSessionManager, you should disable fallback session
    management: QGuiApplication::setFallbackSessionManagementEnabled().

    No user interaction is possible \e unless the application gets explicit
    permission from the session manager. You ask for permission by calling
    allowsInteraction() or, if it is really urgent, allowsErrorInteraction().
    Qt does not enforce this, but the session manager may.

    You can try to abort the shutdown process by calling cancel().

    For sophisticated session managers provided on Unix/X11, QSessionManager
    offers further possibilities to fine-tune an application's session
    management behavior: setRestartCommand(), setDiscardCommand(),
    setRestartHint(), setProperty(), requestPhase2(). See the respective
    function descriptions for further details.

    \sa QGuiApplication, {Session Management}

/*! \enum QSessionManager::RestartHint

    This enum type defines the circumstances under which this application wants
    to be restarted by the session manager. The current values are:

    \value  RestartIfRunning    If the application is still running when the
                                session is shut down, it wants to be restarted
                                at the start of the next session.

    \value  RestartAnyway       The application wants to be started at the
                                start of the next session, no matter what.
                                (This is useful for utilities that run just
                                after startup and then quit.)

    \value  RestartImmediately  The application wants to be started immediately
                                whenever it is not running.

    \value  RestartNever        The application does not want to be restarted
                                automatically.

    The default hint is \c RestartIfRunning.

/*!
    Asks the session manager for permission to interact with the user. Returns
    true if interaction is permitted; otherwise returns \c false.

    The rationale behind this mechanism is to make it possible to synchronize
    user interaction during a shutdown. Advanced session managers may ask all
    applications simultaneously to commit their data, resulting in a much
    faster shutdown.

    When the interaction is completed we strongly recommend releasing the user
    interaction semaphore with a call to release(). This way, other
    applications may get the chance to interact with the user while your
    application is still busy saving data. (The semaphore is implicitly
    released when the application exits.)

    If the user decides to cancel the shutdown process during the interaction
    phase, you must tell the session manager that this has happened by calling
    cancel().

    Here's an example of how an application's QGuiApplication::commitDataRequest()
    might be implemented:

    \snippet code/src_gui_kernel_qguiapplication.cpp 1

    If an error occurred within the application while saving its data, you may
    want to try allowsErrorInteraction() instead.

    \sa QGuiApplication::commitDataRequest(), release(), cancel()

{
    Q_D(QSessionManager);
    return d->platformSessionManager->allowsInteraction();
}

/*!
    Returns \c true if error interaction is permitted; otherwise returns \c false.

    This is similar to allowsInteraction(), but also enables the application to
    tell the user about any errors that occur. Session managers may give error
    interaction requests higher priority, which means that it is more likely
    that an error interaction is permitted. However, you are still not
    guaranteed that the session manager will allow interaction.

    tell whether it has been restored or what the current session identifier
    is.
    See QGuiApplication::isSessionRestored() and

    If your application is very simple, it may be possible to store the entire
    application state in additional command line options. This is usually a
    very bad idea because command lines are often limited to a few hundred
    bytes. Instead, use QSettings, temporary files, or a database for this
    purpose. By marking the data with the unique sessionId(), you will be able
    to restore the application in a future  session.
