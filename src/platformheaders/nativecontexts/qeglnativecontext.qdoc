  \class QEGLNativeContext
  \inmodule QtPlatformHeaders
  \since 5.4

  \brief A class encapsulating an EGL context and display handle.

  \note There is no binary compatibility guarantee for this class, meaning
  that an application using it is only guaranteed to work with the Qt version it was
  developed against.

  \note Due to being public while relying on otherwise hidden EGL types, this header
  itself does not include \c{EGL/egl.h}. It is the application's responsibility to
  include egl.h with any appropriate defines (for example, \c{MESA_EGL_NO_X11_HEADERS}
  or other vendor-specific defines controlling the typedefs for EGL's native resources)
  before this header.

  \sa QOpenGLContext::setNativeHandle(), QOpenGLContext::nativeHandle()
 */

/*!
  \fn EGLContext QEGLNativeContext::context() const

  \return the EGL context.
 */

/*!
  \fn EGLDisplay QEGLNativeContext::display() const

  \return the EGL display.
 */

/*!
  \fn QEGLNativeContext::QEGLNativeContext()

  Construct a new instance with no handles.
 */

/*!
  \fn QEGLNativeContext::QEGLNativeContext(EGLContext ctx, EGLDisplay dpy)

  Constructs a new instance with the provided \a ctx and \a dpy handles.
