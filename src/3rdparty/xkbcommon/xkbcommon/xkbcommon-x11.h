 * Setup the XKB X11 extension for this X client.

 * an X client must notify the server that it will be using the extension.
 * This function (or an XCB equivalent) must be called before any other
 * function in this library is used.
 *
 * Some X servers may not support or disable the XKB extension.  If you
 * want to support such servers, you need to use a different fallback.
 *
 * You may call this function several times; it is idempotent.
 *
 * @param connection
 *     An XCB connection to the X server.
 * @param major_xkb_version, minor_xkb_version
 *     The XKB extension version to request.  To operate correctly, you
 *     must have (major_xkb_version, minor_xkb_version) >=
 *     (XKB_X11_MIN_MAJOR_XKB_VERSION, XKB_X11_MIN_MINOR_XKB_VERSION),
 *     though this is not enforced.
 * @param flags
 *     Optional flags, or 0.
 * @param[out] major_xkb_version_out, minor_xkb_version_out
 *     Backfilled with the compatible XKB extension version numbers picked
 *     by the server.  Can be NULL.
 * @param[out] base_event_out
 *     Backfilled with the XKB base (also known as first) event code, needed
 *     to distinguish XKB events.  Can be NULL.
 * @param[out] base_error_out
 *     Backfilled with the XKB base (also known as first) error code, needed
 *     to distinguish XKB errors.  Can be NULL.
 *
 * @returns 1 on success, or 0 on failure.
