    \brief Provides classes for unit testing Qt applications and libraries.

    Applications that use Qt's unit testing classes need to
    be configured to be built against the Qt Test module.
    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the
    following directive:

    \snippet code/doc_src_qttest.cpp 0

    \if !defined(qtforpython)
    To link against the module, add this line to your \l qmake \c
    .pro file:

    \snippet code/doc_src_qttest.pro 1
    \endif

    See \l{Qt Test Overview} for an introduction on how to use
    Qt's unit testing features with your applications.
