   \brief The QTest namespace contains all the functions and
   declarations that are related to Qt Test.

   See the \l{Qt Test Overview} for information about how to write unit tests.
*/

/*! \macro QVERIFY(condition)

   \relates QTest

   The QVERIFY() macro checks whether the \a condition is true or not. If it is
   true, execution continues. If not, a failure is recorded in the test log
   and the test won't be executed further.

   \b {Note:} This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked
   by the test framework.

   Example:
   \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 0

   \sa QCOMPARE(), QTRY_VERIFY()
*/

/*! \macro QVERIFY2(condition, message)

    \relates QTest

    The QVERIFY2() macro behaves exactly like QVERIFY(), except that it outputs
    a verbose \a message when \a condition is false. The \a message is a plain
    C string.

    Example:
    \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 1

    \sa QVERIFY(), QCOMPARE()
*/

/*! \macro QCOMPARE(actual, expected)

   \relates QTest

   The QCOMPARE macro compares an \a actual value to an \a expected value using
   the equals operator. If \a actual and \a expected are identical, execution
   continues. If not, a failure is recorded in the test log and the test
   won't be executed further.

   In the case of comparing floats and doubles, qFuzzyCompare() is used for
   comparing. This means that comparing to 0 will likely fail. One solution
   to this is to compare to 1, and add 1 to the produced output.

   QCOMPARE tries to output the contents of the values if the comparison fails,
   so it is visible from the test log why the comparison failed.

   For your own classes, you can use \l QTest::toString() to format values for
   outputting into the test log.

   \note This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked
   by the test framework.

   Example:
   \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 2

   \sa QVERIFY(), QTRY_COMPARE(), QTest::toString()
*/

/*! \macro QVERIFY_EXCEPTION_THROWN(expression, exceptiontype)
   \since 5.3

   \relates QTest

   The QVERIFY_EXCEPTION_THROWN macro executes an \a expression and tries
   to catch an exception thrown from the \a expression. If the \a expression
   throws an exception and its type is the same as \a exceptiontype
   or \a exceptiontype is substitutable with the type of thrown exception
   (i.e. usually the type of thrown exception is publicly derived
   from \a exceptiontype) then execution will be continued. If not-substitutable
   type of exception is thrown or the \a expression doesn't throw an exception
   at all, then a failure will be recorded in the test log and
   the test won't be executed further.

   \note This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked
   by the test framework.
*/

/*! \macro QTRY_VERIFY_WITH_TIMEOUT(condition, timeout)
   \since 5.0

   \relates QTest

   The QTRY_VERIFY_WITH_TIMEOUT() macro is similar to QVERIFY(), but checks the \a condition
   repeatedly, until either the condition becomes true or the \a timeout (in milliseconds) is
   reached.  Between each evaluation, events will be processed.  If the timeout
   is reached, a failure is recorded in the test log and the test won't be
   executed further.

   \note This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked
   by the test framework.

   \sa QTRY_VERIFY(), QTRY_VERIFY2_WITH_TIMEOUT(), QVERIFY(), QCOMPARE(), QTRY_COMPARE()
*/


/*! \macro QTRY_VERIFY(condition)
   \since 5.0

   \relates QTest

   Checks the \a condition by invoking QTRY_VERIFY_WITH_TIMEOUT() with a timeout of five seconds.

   \note This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked
   by the test framework.

   \sa QTRY_VERIFY_WITH_TIMEOUT(), QTRY_VERIFY2(), QVERIFY(), QCOMPARE(), QTRY_COMPARE()
*/

/*! \macro QTRY_VERIFY2_WITH_TIMEOUT(condition, message, timeout)
   \since 5.6

   \relates QTest

   The QTRY_VERIFY2_WITH_TIMEOUT macro is similar to QTRY_VERIFY_WITH_TIMEOUT()
   except that it outputs a verbose \a message when \a condition is still false
   after the specified \a timeout (in milliseconds). The \a message is a plain C string.

   Example:
   \code
   QTRY_VERIFY2_WITH_TIMEOUT(list.size() > 2, QByteArray::number(list.size()).constData(), 10000);
   \endcode

   \note This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked
   by the test framework.

   \since 5.6

   \relates QTest

   Checks the \a condition by invoking QTRY_VERIFY2_WITH_TIMEOUT() with a timeout
   of five seconds. If \a condition is then still false, \a message is output.
   The \a message is a plain C string.

   Example:
   \code
   QTRY_VERIFY2_WITH_TIMEOUT(list.size() > 2, QByteArray::number(list.size()).constData());
   \endcode

/*! \macro QTRY_COMPARE_WITH_TIMEOUT(actual, expected, timeout)
   \since 5.0

   \relates QTest

   The QTRY_COMPARE_WITH_TIMEOUT() macro is similar to QCOMPARE(), but performs the comparison
   of the \a actual and \a expected values repeatedly, until either the two values
   are equal or the \a timeout (in milliseconds) is reached.  Between each comparison, events
   will be processed.  If the timeout is reached, a failure is recorded in the
   test log and the test won't be executed further.

/*! \macro QTRY_COMPARE(actual, expected)
   \since 5.0

   \relates QTest

   Performs a comparison of the \a actual and \a expected values by
   invoking QTRY_COMPARE_WITH_TIMEOUT() with a timeout of five seconds.

   \note This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked
   by the test framework.

   \sa QTRY_COMPARE_WITH_TIMEOUT(), QCOMPARE(), QVERIFY(), QTRY_VERIFY()
*/

/*! \macro QFETCH(type, name)

   \relates QTest

   The fetch macro creates a local variable named \a name with the type \a type
   on the stack. \a name has to match the element name from the test's data.
   If no such element exists, the test will assert.

   Assuming a test has the following data:

   \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 3

   The test data has two elements, a QString called \c aString and an integer
   called \c expected. To fetch these values in the actual test:

   \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 4

   \c aString and \c expected are variables on the stack that are initialized with
   the current test data.

   \b {Note:} This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked
   by the test framework. The test function must have a _data function.
*/

/*! \macro QWARN(message)

   \relates QTest
   \threadsafe

   Appends \a message as a warning to the test log. This macro can be used anywhere
   in your tests.
*/

/*! \macro QFAIL(message)

   \relates QTest

   This macro can be used to force a test failure. The test stops
   executing and the failure \a message is appended to the test log.

   \b {Note:} This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked
   by the test framework.

   Example:

   \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 5
*/

/*! \macro QTEST(actual, testElement)

   \relates QTest

   QTEST() is a convenience macro for \l QCOMPARE() that compares
   the value \a actual with the element \a testElement from the test's data.
   If there is no such element, the test asserts.

   Apart from that, QTEST() behaves exactly as \l QCOMPARE().

   Instead of writing:

   \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 6

   you can write:

   \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 7

   \sa QCOMPARE()
*/

/*! \macro QSKIP(description)

   \relates QTest

   If called from a test function, the QSKIP() macro stops execution of the test
   without adding a failure to the test log. You can use it to skip tests that
   wouldn't make sense in the current configuration. The text \a description is
   appended to the test log and should contain an explanation of why the test
   couldn't be executed.

   If the test is data-driven, each call to QSKIP() will skip only the current
   row of test data, so an unconditional call to QSKIP will produce one skip
   message in the test log for each row of test data.

   If called from an _data function, the QSKIP() macro will stop execution of
   the _data function and will prevent execution of the associated test
   function.

   If called from initTestCase() or initTestCase_data(), the QSKIP() macro will
   skip all test and _data functions.

   \b {Note:} This macro can only be used in a test function or _data
   function that is invoked by the test framework.

   Example:
   \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 8
*/

/*! \macro QEXPECT_FAIL(dataIndex, comment, mode)

   \relates QTest

   The QEXPECT_FAIL() macro marks the next \l QCOMPARE() or \l QVERIFY() as an
   expected failure. Instead of adding a failure to the test log, an expected
   failure will be reported.

   If a \l QVERIFY() or \l QCOMPARE() is marked as an expected failure,
   but passes instead, an unexpected pass (XPASS) is written to the test log.

   The parameter \a dataIndex describes for which entry in the test data the
   failure is expected. Pass an empty string (\c{""}) if the failure
   is expected for all entries or if no test data exists.

   \a comment will be appended to the test log for the expected failure.

   \a mode is a \l QTest::TestFailMode and sets whether the test should
   continue to execute or not.

   \b {Note:} This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked
   by the test framework.

   Example 1:
   \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 9

   In the example above, an expected fail will be written into the test output
   if the variable \c i is not 42. If the variable \c i is 42, an unexpected pass
   is written instead. The QEXPECT_FAIL() has no influence on the second QCOMPARE()
   statement in the example.

   Example 2:
   \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 10

   The above testfunction will not continue executing for the test data
   entry \c{data27}.

   \sa QTest::TestFailMode, QVERIFY(), QCOMPARE()
*/

/*! \macro QFINDTESTDATA(filename)
   \since 5.0

   \relates QTest

   Returns a QString for the testdata file referred to by \a filename, or an
   empty QString if the testdata file could not be found.

   This macro allows the test to load data from an external file without
   hardcoding an absolute filename into the test, or using relative paths
   which may be error prone.

   The returned path will be the first path from the following list which
   resolves to an existing file or directory:

   \list
   \li \a filename relative to QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath()
      (only if a QCoreApplication or QApplication object has been created).
   \li \a filename relative to the test's standard install directory
      (QLibraryInfo::TestsPath with the lowercased testcase name appended).
   \li \a filename relative to the directory containing the source file from which
      QFINDTESTDATA is invoked.
   \endlist

   If the named file/directory does not exist at any of these locations,
   a warning is printed to the test log.

   For example, in this code:
   \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 26

   The testdata file will be resolved as the first existing file from:

   \list
   \li \c{/home/user/build/myxmlparser/tests/tst_myxmlparser/testxml/simple1.xml}
   \li \c{/usr/local/Qt-5.0.0/tests/tst_myxmlparser/testxml/simple1.xml}
   \li \c{/home/user/sources/myxmlparser/tests/tst_myxmlparser/testxml/simple1.xml}
   \endlist

   This allows the test to find its testdata regardless of whether the
   test has been installed, and regardless of whether the test's build tree
   is equal to the test's source tree.

   \b {Note:} reliable detection of testdata from the source directory requires
   either that qmake is used, or the \c{QT_TESTCASE_BUILDDIR} macro is defined to
   point to the working directory from which the compiler is invoked, or only
   absolute paths to the source files are passed to the compiler. Otherwise, the
   absolute path of the source directory cannot be determined.

   \b {Note:} For tests that use the \l QTEST_APPLESS_MAIN() macro to generate a
   \c{main()} function, \c{QFINDTESTDATA} will not attempt to find test data
   relative to QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath().  In practice, this means that
   tests using \c{QTEST_APPLESS_MAIN()} will fail to find their test data
   if run from a shadow build tree.
*/

/*! \macro QTEST_MAIN(TestClass)

    \relates QTest

    Implements a main() function that instantiates an application object and
    the \a TestClass, and executes all tests in the order they were defined.
    Use this macro to build stand-alone executables.

    If \c QT_WIDGETS_LIB is defined, the application object will be a QApplication,
    if \c QT_GUI_LIB is defined, the application object will be a QGuiApplication,
    otherwise it will be a QCoreApplication.  If qmake is used and the configuration
    includes \c{QT += widgets}, then \c QT_WIDGETS_LIB will be defined automatically.
    Similarly, if qmake is used and the configuration includes \c{QT += gui}, then
    \c QT_GUI_LIB will be defined automatically.

    \b {Note:} On platforms that have keypad navigation enabled by default,
    this macro will forcefully disable it if \c QT_WIDGETS_LIB is defined.  This is done
    to simplify the usage of key events when writing autotests. If you wish to write a
    test case that uses keypad navigation, you should enable it either in the
    \c {initTestCase()} or \c {init()} functions of your test case by calling
    \l {QApplication::setNavigationMode()}.

    Example:
    \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 11

    \sa QTEST_APPLESS_MAIN(), QTEST_GUILESS_MAIN(), QTest::qExec(),
    QApplication::setNavigationMode()

    \fn template<typename T> char *QTest::toString(const T &value)

    Returns a textual representation of \a value. This function is used by
    \l QCOMPARE() to output verbose information in case of a test failure.

    You can add specializations or overloads of this function to your test to enable
    verbose output.

    \b {Note:} Starting with Qt 5.5, you should prefer to provide a toString() function
    in the type's namespace instead of specializing this template.
    If your code needs to continue to work with the QTestLib from Qt 5.4 or
    earlier, you need to continue to use specialization.

    \b {Note:} The caller of toString() must delete the returned data
    using \c{delete[]}.  Your implementation should return a string
    created with \c{new[]} or qstrdup(). The easiest way to do so is to
    create a QByteArray or QString and calling QTest::toString() on it
    (see second example below).

    Example for specializing (Qt ≤ 5.4):

    \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 16

    The example above defines a toString() specialization for a class
    called \c MyPoint. Whenever a comparison of two instances of \c
    MyPoint fails, \l QCOMPARE() will call this function to output the
    contents of \c MyPoint to the test log.

    \brief The QTouchEventSequence class is used to simulate a sequence of touch events.

    To simulate a sequence of touch events on a specific device for a window or widget, call
    QTest::touchEvent to create a QTouchEventSequence instance. Add touch events to
    the sequence by calling press(), move(), release() and stationary(), and let the
    instance run out of scope to commit the sequence to the event system.

    Example:

    Commits this sequence of touch events, unless autoCommit was disabled, and frees allocated resources.

/*!
  \fn void QTest::QTouchEventSequence::commit(bool processEvents)

   Commits this sequence of touch events to the event system. Normally there is no need to call this
   function because it is called from the destructor. However, if autoCommit is disabled, the events
   only get committed upon explicitly calling this function.

   In special cases tests may want to disable the processing of the events. This can be achieved by
   setting \a processEvents to false. This results in merely queuing the events, the event loop will
   not be forced to process them.
