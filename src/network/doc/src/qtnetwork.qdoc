    \title Qt Network
    \brief Provides networking capabilities

    Qt Network provides a set of APIs for programming applications that use
    TCP/IP. Operations such as requests, cookies, and sending data over HTTP
    are handled by various C++ classes.

    \section1 Getting Started

    To use Qt Network classes,add this directive into the C++ files:
    \code
    #include <QtNetwork>
    \endcode

    \if !defined(qtforpython)
    To link against the Qt Network module, add this line to the project file:
    \code
    QT += network
    \endcode
    \endif

    \section1 Articles and Guides

    These articles contain information about Qt Network setup and about
    applications with networking capabilities.
    \list
    \li \l{Network Programming with Qt} - Programming applications with networking capabilities
    \li \l{Bearer Management} - An API to control the system's connectivity state
    \li \l{Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Classes} - Classes for secure communication over network sockets
    \endlist

    \section1 API Reference
    These are links to the API reference materials.

    \section1 Licenses and Attributions

    Qt Network is available under commercial licenses from \l{The Qt Company}.
    In addition, it is available under the
    \l{GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3}, or
    the \l{GNU General Public License, version 2}.
    See \l{Qt Licensing} for further details.

    Qt Network can use the \l{OpenSSL Toolkit} as a backend. The library is then
    linked against OpenSSL in a way that requires compliance with the \l{OpenSSL
    License}. To allow linking OpenSSL with Qt Network under the GPL, following
    exceptions to the GPL do apply:

    \badcode
    In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders listed above give
    permission to link the code of its release of Qt with the OpenSSL project's
    "OpenSSL" library (or modified versions of the "OpenSSL" library that use the
    same license as the original version), and distribute the linked executables.

    You must comply with the GNU General Public License version 2 in all
    respects for all of the code used other than the "OpenSSL" code.  If you
    modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the file,
    but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete
    this exception statement from your version of this file.
    \endcode

    Also note shipping OpenSSL might cause \l{Import and Export Restrictions}
    to apply.
