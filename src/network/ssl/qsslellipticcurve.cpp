    \class QSslEllipticCurve

    \brief Represents an elliptic curve for use by elliptic-curve cipher algorithms.

    \reentrant
    \ingroup network
    \ingroup ssl
    \inmodule QtNetwork

    The class QSslEllipticCurve represents an elliptic curve for use by
    elliptic-curve cipher algorithms.

    Elliptic curves can be constructed from a "short name" (SN) (fromShortName()),
    and by a call to QSslConfiguration::supportedEllipticCurves().

    QSslEllipticCurve instances can be compared for equality and can be used as keys
    in QHash and QSet. They cannot be used as key in a QMap.
*/

/*!
    \fn QSslEllipticCurve::QSslEllipticCurve()

    Constructs an invalid elliptic curve.

/*!
    \fn QSslEllipticCurve QSslEllipticCurve::fromShortName(const QString &name)

    Returns an QSslEllipticCurve instance representing the
    named curve \a name. The \a name is the conventional short
    name for the curve, as represented by RFC 4492 (for instance \c{secp521r1}),
    or as NIST short names (for instance \c{P-256}). The actual set of
    recognized names depends on the SSL implementation.

    If the given \a name is not supported, returns an invalid QSslEllipticCurve instance.

    \note The OpenSSL implementation of this function treats the name case-sensitively.

    \sa shortName()
*/

/*!
    \fn QSslEllipticCurve QSslEllipticCurve::fromLongName(const QString &name)

    Returns an QSslEllipticCurve instance representing the named curve \a name.
    The \a name is a long name for the curve, whose exact spelling depends on the
    SSL implementation.

    If the given \a name is not supported, returns an invalid QSslEllipticCurve instance.

    \note The OpenSSL implementation of this function treats the name case-sensitively.

    Returns the conventional short name for this curve. If this
    curve is invalid, returns an empty string.

/*!
    \fn QString QSslEllipticCurve::longName() const

    Returns the conventional long name for this curve. If this
    curve is invalid, returns an empty string.

    \fn bool QSslEllipticCurve::isValid() const

    Returns true if this elliptic curve is a valid curve, false otherwise.
*/

/*!
    \fn bool QSslEllipticCurve::isTlsNamedCurve() const

    Returns true if this elliptic curve is one of the named curves that can be
    used in the key exchange when using an elliptic curve cipher with TLS;
    false otherwise.

*/

/*!
    \fn bool operator!=(QSslEllipticCurve lhs, QSslEllipticCurve rhs)

    false otherwise.
