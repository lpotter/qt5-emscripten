    \title Qt SQL
    \brief Provides a driver layer, SQL API layer, and a user
    interface layer for SQL databases

    Qt SQL is an essential module which provides support for SQL databases. Qt
    SQL's APIs are divided into different layers:

    \list
    \li Driver layer
    \li SQL API layer
    \li User interface layer
    \endlist
    The \l{SQL Programming} guide contains information about development using
    Qt SQL.

    \section1 Getting Started
    To enable Qt SQL in a project, add this directive into the C++ files:
    \code
    #include <QtSql>
    \endcode
    To link against the Qt SQL module, add this line to the project file:
    \code
    QT += sql
    \endcode

    \section1 Licenses and Attributions

    Qt SQL is available under commercial licenses from \l{The Qt Company}.
    In addition, it is available under free software licenses. Since Qt 5.4,
