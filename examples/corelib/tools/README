Qt is equipped with a range of capable tool classes, from containers and
iterators to classes for string handling and manipulation.

Other classes provide application infrastructure support, handling plugin
loading and managing configuration files.


Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
