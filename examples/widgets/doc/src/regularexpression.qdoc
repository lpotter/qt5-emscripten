    \title QRegularExpression Example
    \ingroup examples-widgets-tools

    \brief The QRegularExpression example shows how regular expressions in Qt are
    applied to text by providing an environment in which new regular expressions can be
    created and tested on custom text strings.

    The example makes usage of the QRegularExpression class, which has been
    introduced in Qt 5.0. QRegularExpression implements Perl-compatible regular
    expressions, supporting a number of advanced matching features, such as
    case insensitive matching, multiline matching, Unicode properties selectors
    and partial/incremental matching.

    QRegularExpression is a big improvement over QRegExp in terms of features
    and performance and should be used in all new code.
