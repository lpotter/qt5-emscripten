    \quotefromfile itemviews/dirview/main.cpp
    \skipto QCommandLineParser parser
    \printuntil parser.positionalArguments

    The example supports a number of command line options.
    These options include:
    \list
        \li Application description
        \li -help option
        \li -version option
        \li if the optionc {-c} is specified, the application will not
            use custom directory options
    \endlist

    \skipto QFileSystemModel
    \printuntil tree.setModel

    Declares \c model as data model for reading the local filesystem.
    \c model.setRootPath("") sets the current folder as the folder from
    which \c model will start reading.
    QTreeView object \c tree visualizes the filesystem in a tree structure.

    \skipto tree.setAnimated(false)
    \printuntil tree.setWindowTitle

    Sets layout options for animation, indentation, sorting, and sizing of the
    filesystem tree.
