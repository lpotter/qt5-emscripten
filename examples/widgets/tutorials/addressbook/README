The Address Book Tutorial shows how to put together a simple yet
fully-functioning GUI application. The tutorial chapters can be found in the
Qt documentation, which can be viewed using Qt Assistant or a Web browser.

The tutorial is also available online at

http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtwidgets/tutorials-addressbook.html

All programs corresponding to the chapters in the tutorial should
automatically be built when Qt is compiled, or will be provided as
pre-built executables if you have obtained a binary package of Qt.

If you have only compiled the Qt libraries, use the following instructions
to build the tutorial.

On Linux/Unix:

Typing 'make' in this directory builds all the programs (part1/part1,
part2/part2, part3/part3 and so on). Typing 'make' in each subdirectory
builds just that tutorial program.

On Windows:

Create a single Visual Studio project for the tutorial directory in
the usual way. You can do this by typing the following at the command
line:

qmake -tp vc

You should now be able to open the project file in Visual Studio and
build all of the tutorial programs at the same time.

On Mac OS X:

Create an Xcode project with the .pro file in the tutorial directory.
You can do this by typing the following at the command line:

qmake -spec macx-xcode

Then open the generated Xcode project in Xcode and build it.
