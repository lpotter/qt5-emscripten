Lexgen
------

This is a little tool to generate lexical scanners from a rather simplistic
configuration file. We use it internally in Qt to generate the scanner for the
CSS parser that is built into the toolkit (used for the widget styling and the
HTML import into QTextDocument).

Beware, it's very slow (in generating the code) and it may not generate what
you want. But I like that it generates code that operates on QChar and friends.

Use at your own risk ;-)
